        "Personally, my favorite reaction to the death of The Queen came from a tiktok video. A girl walks in to wake up her sister, telling her something really bad happened while she was napping... The Queen died. Sister just waking up takes a few seconds to process, gets a shocked sad look on her face and whispers, \"Dolly?\" But no, it was the actual Queen of England, and the relief was palpable. Dolly Parton is a queen though. She got that right!",

        "Excellent video as always. John and team, I would like to add that I find it really surprising in your coverage of the monarchy and the other videos you have done surrounding the problems they perpetuate, Pakistan and the partition of the subcontinent in 1947 have not come up even once. When talking about the atrocities of the monarchy, I find it really lacking that their colonial rule of 400 years which devastated us completely and continues to fuck us over, is not really talked about. As a viewer from Pakistan, I would really appreciate it if one day you could talk about all these things and the ways in which British rule continues to impact us.",

        "John Oliver, thank you for spending 30 minutes unpacking some of the most important details of human history.  I majored in history in college, and one of the biggest takeaways I had (besides realizing I should have majored in Engineering), is that the fate of our species depends largely upon whether we decide to just give up the war and finally get along.  Tribal warfare was cute when there wasn't the planet's health or our ability to live without fear of a hurricane wrecking the neighborhood to worry about.  If folks can hold these 2 thoughts, 1) We can sincerely mourn the loss of Queen Elizabeth, and 2) We need to acknowledge her legacy \u2013 with all its flaws \u2013 and seriously examine whether the Monarch itself is relevant today, then I think we are still moving forward as a people.",
        "Look John, was there ever a strange guy in an old pub of the aristocracy standing nex to you and very strangely knocking out a young lords friends, but not the young big mouth himself?\nThere are different kinds of aristocrats. Some are nobleman, some are lords, some are knights. Nobleman come as lords or knights and act noble as diplomats or in arms. Lords are businessman with priveliges based on their families blood lines good deads for the commons. And knight fight war using violance. Of those some are from the nobility and others are from deep in the woods having pig and fishfarms using an axe over a sword historically because that tool wont rise suspicion when they taking out a Sheriff of Nottingham. The latter is never a prince and like the knight in the movie Iron Clad.",

        "I think it\u2019ll be a lot easier to have this conversation now that the queen has passed. I don\u2019t think the average person likes Charles\u2026 including me to be honest. So it\u2019s easier to be critical of them and call them out for the darker side of the symbol they represent.",
        "Yeah, nah, if anyone wants a neutral explanation, go see the video \"The True Cost of the Royal Family\" from CGP Grey. That will tell what you need to know about the financial part.\n\nWhen it comes to slavery, colonization, I guess it comes down to a personal perception. I am not one for considering people guilty for what their ancestors did two or three centuries ago. And for the recent cases, it is also not reasonable to blame someone who isn't even part of the government for any and whatever atrocities said government has comited. Would you blame Obama for the tortures in Guantanamo? Maybe to some extent. But I don't suppose if he died tomorrow people would cheer that the responsible for the tortures had died. And he WAS actually the head of government, unlike the queen. Seems kind of in poor taste to me.",
        "Well.... America didn't give up and close the Indian boarding schools until 1978, the Indian Welfare Act gave families a choice to send their children or not. However, not every school closed until 1996. You read that right, 1996...  Even today there are residential Indian schools but their mission is vastly different than it was. The UK closing Indian schools in the 1960s was more progressive than the US. With that said, thank you John for bringing all this to light.",

        "Excalibur Air Fresheners\n\nFirstly, if someone is using King Arthur you can bet something sinister is going on.  Though Arthurian Legends paint positivity onto the Middle Ages their reality was quite different.  King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table was completely fictional and written as a political tool for the Ages to overcome disorder and conflict.  People often use Merlin, Arthur, Mordred, Lancelot, Gawain, Guinevere, and Excalibur as a tool for painting nobility and honor onto an otherwise dark regime or situation.  The truth is that due to common pragmatic realities one cannot maintain an aesthetic that grand, and it has been used either as a means of eliminating that dream or as hiding a more sinister plot.  Arthurian Legends, thus, become more like an elitist air freshener in a dirty car more than a noble aesthetic.",

There are cases of under 15 year olds beaten to death bt batons. Right now there is a war-like fight happening in Mahabad where people are defending their lives with rocks and getting killed by non-stoping firing guns.

        "John's commentary is amazing",
        "The British royal family through no personal fault of their own are from the Hanovarian royal line which is principally German. Because of the atrocities caused by the Nazi regime in WW2 they had to distance themselves from their origins by not only changing their surname to Windsor but to go out in public and be more visible to ordinary people and to show they cared about their ordinary subjects. This worked as a stabilizing factor to bring the citizens of Great Britain together under one flag and give the people a unified sense of identity.  However being so public enabled the media which is always negative to put their lives under the microscope and this in turn disabled both the Monarchy and the royal family to live a decent sheltered life. The long term effect of this has put such a strain on these individuals who are essentially human beings that it has been very destructive to both their personal lives and their reputation. ",
        "As I recall history, the Charles'/James' Stuart dynasty was replaced by the Dutch van Nassau dynasty, which in turn was replaced by the German \"Brunswick\" (Braunschweig) dynasty.

Gasoline (Middle East)?  Gemstones (Africa, South America, and Asia)?  Eating with a fork (Middle East)?  International medicine (every country England conquered)?  International education?  How many lives have those saved?  Is colonialism right?  Hell no!  It had a lot of benefits on the international stage though.  Finally, should we judge the living by the acts of their dead ancestors.  Look at QE2.  She is the monarch who gave their freedom back to those countries.  Few other monarchs in history have ever done that.  Could she have done more?  Maybe, but she did more than any of her ancestors have ever done.  We have a long way to go to make up for the horrors of colonialism, but do we look at the descendants of the French, Italian, Chinese or Japanese monarchies (current Japanese emperors) and ask them to pay for their ancestors' colonial pasts?  Some of those committed atrocities worse than England.",

Two of King James II\u2019s daughters took the throne after him, the first daughter Queen Mary ruled with her husband William of Orange (from Holland) after the so called \u201cGlorious Revolution\u201d of 1688 (which drove off the unwanted Catholic King James II) and the second Queen Anne who died without living children in 1707.
