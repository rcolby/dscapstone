        "DA Opper:  You did absolutely amazing job prosecuting DB under imaginable stressful situation.  Congratulations on a job well done to you and your outstanding legal team.",
        "He is innocent",
        "All  he cared about was his self.",
        "The prosecuting attorneys did an exceptional job! It was touching  Judge Dorow named each victim. I\u2019m sure this means so much to the family and friends. The entire team showed so much patience. May the fallen victims RIP. Yes, the entire nation was behind your team to get the monster Darrell Brooks put behind bars for life! It\u2019s time for each of you to take a vacation with your loved ones.",
        "Good job le, da and judge.",
        "Ms.Opper you did an excellent job.",
        "From NC .  These victims were are family and we were with them in spirit. We watched everyday of the trial,  we were offended, hurt, deeply sadden, then relieved.   We are grieving along side of you and rejoice with you, for every step of progress they make.  ",
        "She is so impressive professionally and did the victims justice with presenting the case.  Her team worked hard and dealt with the case so well!",
        "Sue Opper and her Prosecution team and Judge Jennifer R. Dorow are The Best! To the Waukesha Community? Please keep on being strong! God bless you all!",
        "I love you, and thank you DA Sue Opper for all your hard work. May God continue to bless you and keep you. Excellent ",
        "When I first started watching the trial I thought the judge was crazy for letting him act the way he was acting. But she was making sure that she was keeping decorum and leaving him no chance to come back and say that he didn't get a fair trial. That's why he kept asking to be held in contempt. Even though she was never holding him in contempt. He kept asking. Are you holding me in contempt? Because when you're held a contempt you go back to the jail cell and then he could say I wasn't there to hear the trial even though he was hugely disruptive and did everything he could to derail. They actually did an excellent job getting his case through as quickly and professionally as possible",
        "Sue Opper was brilliant. She showed the utmost respect and professionalism, and was stoic in the face of this monster. I was so impressed with her team and the case they presented.",
        "Bravo . I hope you can finally relax and enjoy not having to deal with that monster anymore ",
        "Your team and the judge showed heroic patience with the accused. I don\u2019t think I could take the abuse he doled out on a consistent basis. You all are true professionals.",
        "Sue Opper and the other Attorneys need a big Bonus for what they had to deal with let alone and sit and have to listen. They were all so calm and well informed. They did their job and so much more. Their respect they showed (tolerated). God Bless them for being so calm and letting him try himself. And Bless all those that are suffering from this and also Darrel\u2019s ex baby Momma and her family. How horror his children.",
        "She remained steadfast. Great work Att. OPPER,JUDGE DOROW and team.",
        "Thank you from Pennsylvania..you are loved around the world\u2026we can only imagine how hard it was for everyone to deal with that piece of garbage\u2026may the lord give everyone the comfort they need going forward",
        "We watched the proceedings from Canada and the professionalism and patience of the judge and all of you on the prosecution side was amazing.  We are so grateful that justice was served for the families of the victims.",
        "We love you Mrs. Sue. You are a rock star. ",
        "God bless you.  Thank you",
        "The fact that db said this was an open and shut case speaks volumes.   He knew what was coming",
        "Sue looked like she just got back from a much needed vacation after all this.great tan",
        "Ms.sue opper u did a fine job may God continue to bless u",
        "The absolute patience of everyone in the courtroom makes them saints imo. \n\nBrooks isn\u2019t insane. He\u2019s simply an absolute POS human.",
        "I wouldn't want to be in jail with her",
        "I\u2019m so grateful justice had it\u2019s purpose done for the families involved Also I\u2019m very for all lost their love ones",
        "Good job, Prosecution Team! I wish he was going straight to prison, but the Milwaukee trial..... Couldn't Milwaukee waive his trial and just get him on into prison?",
        "DA sue opper. I do no know u, but you are one brilliant and tough cookie. He tried to insult you, but his words are only mumbo jumbo. He cud not handle you defeating him big time at every turn. His superiority is inferior to your and your teams minority. HOORAY, hooray.",
        "Madam DA\u2026Ms. Sue Opper\u2026thank you so much for a job well done! And you are correct, the WHOLE USA and many many people from other countries even support Judge Darow and the entire prosecution for putting this \u201cman\u201d behind bars for the REST of his life. Signed, a Supporter from Pleasant Garden, North Carolina!!",
        "I have the utmost respect for DA Sue Opper.  She and her team are phenomenal and did their best work to hold \u201chim\u201d accountable for his heinous, unforiveable crimes against good and innocent victims.  for Ms. Opper, her team and Judge Dorow.",
        "CONGRATS, PROSECUTION TEAM!",
        "So happy these family's don't have to go through this trial any longer. Truly heartbreaking that they had to go through all of that. The trial was the opening of their wounds that have not yet healed.",
        "I wish I could send a message to this incredible woman and know how much I respect her and am grateful for her and her whole amazing team!! They showed so much compassion, strength, fairness, wisdom, professionalism,  integrity and service to and for their community.  Way to go guys! Prayers and love for all of Waukesha from Texas \ufe0f  ",
        "Absolutely amazing lady \ufe0f",
        "I love this woman. She said \u201c I don\u2019t care what you care about \u201c after saying that he\u2019s weak and as he sits there has no control  0 . I\u2019m so happy that the right thing was done and he will now be behind bars for the rest of his life. I know he\u2019s probably in his cell right now yelling \u201c Objection \u201c and \u201c Grounds \u201c  he did go on for 2 hours when asked about his sentence. I honestly thought that he wasn\u2019t gonna stop",
        "Thank you Hon. Judge Dorow and court staff, DA Sue Opper and the prosecution team, the jurors, and to the victims that testified and families that gave impact statements. Waukesha, you\u2019re free from him. The world is. I hope they bury him under the prison, so he can continue his 1000 year sentence after death.",
        "Let\u2019s not forget the stone faced baliff!",
        "Wonderful professional woman",
        "Self pity and hate caused this, a lifetime of mommy bailing out a punk, with no father in sight.",
        "Go Waukesha!!!",
        "Now people can stop saying hateful comments about the Judge. She knew what she was doing through the whole trial. She was very professional and wanted to make sure that everything was done by the book, all t's were crossed, eyes were dotted and no chance of Parole. EVER!",
        "I am from Ohio and I had been following this trial. It feels very satisfying to see justice being served.",
        "I watched the entire trial. I don't live in WI, but feel their pain and love their sense of community. I'd love to hug all the victims who showed up to speak their truth in court. When the sentences were announced I surprised myself--I burst out in tears. I didn't realize how much this case had gotten to me. Bless Waukesha and keep healing.",
        "DA SUE OPPER....THANK YOI AND YOUR TRSM FR A GRATEFUL NATION. YOU ARE A REAL SERVANT OF THE CITIZENRY.",
        "I followed this case from beginning and I'm from Jersey. I'm surprised I don't hear about it more. This was such an unspeakable horrific act partly because it was at a parade  among many other things. I felt so many strong emotions and learned a lot. May Darrel Brooks rot in jail",
        "She\u2019s great but she does have a frown all the time I noticed.",
        "I was very impressed with the prosecution team, the judge, the jury, and the people in the court room and how they all showed integrity and respect. As a viewer, I found myself wanting to yell at the monster\u2019s behavior throughout this trial. May God be with you all as you continue to heal.",
        "From Australia, been following the whole case! Really a beautiful sight to see justice served, all thoughts to the families that they can mourn and commemorate the 1 year anniversary knowing justice has been served",
        "   Not just OUR Nation! If you watch YouTube streams (esp Emily D Baker former LA Deputy DA - Warning \"Cursery Words\"), SO MUCH Love, Encouragement, Support, Prayers, & 's sent through Victim Impact Statements from AROUND THE WORLD for ALL OF YOU!! ",
        "Thank u da and the judge  for all your hard work,in my opinion  nr brooks is exactly  where he needs to be,my heart  goes out to all the victims   and familys he destroyed",
        "The amount of unnecessary patience that was shown from the DA office is remarkable. Finally we can say amen and goodbye to that person.  Send him to Colorado...",
        "Well done to you and your Team DA Opper",
        "The whole nation thanks you, DA Opper. This monster could have turned up in any community & destroyed any of our lives. I'm very relieved he'll never be free.",
        "\ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6  says thank you to everyone who spent hours , days, tears, and energy getting through this fiasco \u2026 thank you. Thank you. You have given all of these people a bit of peace , and a lot of validation. Every victim / whether physically hurt or mentally affected is blessed to have you represent them. And to have this wonderful compassionate judge. There couldn\u2019t have been a better team",
        "This lawyer and her team are a credit to their profession!!",
        "Thank you Judge Dorow & DA Opper.  Awesome work for bringing justice!!!",
        "Reviewer ... Politically correct ... I know where your coming from .. you feel sorry for this him because I know why ..",
        "I was at home clapping every time She stated each conviction .......",
        "Thank you , Sue!",
        "Damn shame we're going to let him live.",
        "Jack:  being confused about how Freya is getting across big gabs",
        "Ok, I missed a LOT. Who is Darrell Brooks, and what did he do to get DOUBLE 17y in PRISON?!?! How did I miss any/all of this?!! 0_0",
        "Judge Dorow is a truly remarkable lady and my new number one hero.",
        "Not just those injured were victims in this case. All the people in attendance were.\n      Anyone watching a live feed, those people left dealing with family members' PTSD, their caretakers, and the community's mental health programs will feel this for decades. All the people who actively participate in such parades have been affected by his actions. This even cast a pall over my own joyful memories of participating in Fourth of July parades. What if this had happened to us? How do we stop it in the future? We can't really we can only be vigilant and work to reduce it's likely hood.",
        "God bless you",
        "The media's dumbest question ever, and they just can't seem to grasp what a stupid, irrelevant question it is. \"What were you feeling?........\"",
        "The fact that this prosecution team was able to wrap this up before the 1 year anniversary is actually insane. Especially with this type of defendant, and the magnitude of this case. Sue, Leslie, Zach and the rest of this team did an amazing job for these victims, and of course the Judge did as well.",
        "I would love a biopic for her. She\u2019s astoundingly strong and so professional. I\u2019m so grateful this is done and  to the community!!!!",
        "The legend.",
        "GOOD JOB SUE OPPER AND YOUR TEAM, WELL DONE",
        "1 less spook on the street the brother-hood is thankful",
        "Attorney Opper you and your team had the whole nation behind you all. Your patience your knowledge was outstanding. Thank you for getting that evil man out of our society. God bless everyone involved. Your a role model for my Granddaughters and I thank you for that.",
        "This Da did an excellent job!!! Great work!!",
        "Love DA Sue Opper, Judge Dorow, and the whole prosecution\n team.  What a great job they did!",
        "Waukesha is a community of Phoenixes ",
        "After listening to the mother of the 11 year old girl, about how she had to care for her child after this horrendous event, and to the girl herself talking about the pain she suffers, and the amount of rehab she is still having to go through, I was enraged that anyone could cause so much sorrow, but was thankful that the man faced such skillful and dedicated prosecutors, Jurist, and law enforcement officers and such a focused jury, true justice was handed out to this offender, ( whom I choose not to dignify by using his name) now I hope, they will throw him in the deepest dankest cell in the most dilapidated prison in the state, throw away the key, and forget he even exists.",
        "May he receive final justice soon.",
        "You and your team did a great job!  The fact that you offered options to keep things moving along, as Mr. Brooks was so difficult.  He was demeaning, at times acting like a child, and just wearing -dealing with him on a day to day basis.  Thank you for showing the families that were so tragically impacted, that you kept your commitment to put him away where he could not do harm to anyone else in the free world!!   Much respect to all of you!!  Thank you.!",
        "He will catch a shank in the big house",
        "DA Oper,what a spectacular effort from all your team and everyone in law enforcement on behalf of the state- and to the incredible Judge Daro .How u all got through this trial is beyond me with Brooks driving everyone crazy with his idiocy and courtroom outbursts! A true NARCISSIST IN EVERY WAY!!",
        "Brooks will never be a free man again. Unless, perhaps, a new DA sees fit to re-evaluate his case and release him for some BS reason like his unfortunate childhood, or his unbearable debt, or whatever. No, I do not want that outcome. But it seems to happen more often with each passing year.",
        "I love Sue ..she is an upstanding human.",
        "Sue Opper and Judge Dorow are absolute ROCKSTARS!! Putting up with this bs trial and ensuring an appeal would never be valid! The world watched your grace and intelligence and are THOROUGHLY impressed!! Now give these amazing women a much needed vacation!!!",
        "Brooks is not a man.  There are numerous adjectives to describe him.  Prosecutor Sue Opper called him a coward, a victim called him a POS.  Those were spot on.  A man he is not.",
        "Let's not forget the prosecution worked so hard to lay this all to rest before the anniversary of the massacre. And with an amazing judge at the helm, THEY SUCCEEDED. Now these families and entire community can mourn the anniversary finding peace in the fact that this creature is NEVER going to see the light of day again! ",
        "Sue, you are my hero!",
        "He'll never eat watermelon ever again.",
        "The prosecution are an example of the best of humanity! Sue Opper you\u2019re amazing, I hope you never think twice about what he said about you.",
        "Everyone, aside from Brooks, has been so thoughtful and professional. They really made sure this community was taken care of.",
        "I like Sue. She's a bulldog! Didn't take any sh** from that piece of work",
        "I applaud Sue Opper for her powerful support of the victims it's absolutely incredible how strong/stable Sue Opper maintained her focus during the entire time ratboy abused the courts time.",
        "The judge ruined the decorum she set by letting those people cheer at the verdict. Bad move. There are people like Dahmer and the ice man out here that didn\u2019t get that kind of treatment\n There is a reason judges don\u2019t allow this, this case was no different than any other victims pain in any other case. The point is to above all maintain civility and decorum. Hooping and hollering for 6 life sentences isn\u2019t either.",
        "Thank you, Attorney Opper! We love you and recognize the hard work of not only your team but of YOU as well  (your team rocked too!)",
        "Sue, you and your team are the absolute best!!!  You all need a long vacation, along with the Judge.",
        "Those prosecutors held their tongues and did their job professionally, putting up with things they shouldn\u2019t have had to endure. They can (and should!) hold their heads high. \n\nWell done!!!",
        "Thank you Sue Opper and DA team. Thank you JUDGE DOROW \n\nTHANK YOU LORD GOD FOR EVERYTHING",
        "Sean Ford Federer",
        "It was two hours of word salad.",
        "I want people to appreciate that they wrapped this up in LESS than a year. \n\nThat is highly unusual. For homicide cases, it can take years for a few charges. This prosecution team secured guilty verdicts on 76 charges. That is amazing. And they proved each and every count beyond a reasonable doubt. ",
        "Congratulations to District Attorney Sue Opper! What a tremendously great job you\u2019ve done! I can\u2019t even imagine the organisational challenge that this trial must have been - the dimension and complexity of the case must have required a great deal of nerves and patience for sure. I hope you celebrate your success in working for justice!   Congratulations to you and your team!",
        "Thats unless he gets a president pardon",
        "Watched from the UK - disgusted by this noxious evil wastrel, heartbroken for Waukesha, impressed by Judge Dorrow and the prosecution team.",
        "One problem he's still alive",
        "Thank you Ma\u2019am.",
        "OhhhDarrell...welcome to the 1st day of the rest of your worthless life!! ",
        "I watched while the Judge was reading the sentencing and heard those in attendance applaud for the first six ( deaths ) counts. I believe that the clamping, as the DA said, may not have been proper decorum but they were elated that justice was being served just as it was deserved. We need more of that in this country..Thank you to all of the \u201cJustice\u201d members in this case.",
        "I\u2019m shocked how fast they were able to finish this trial. Cases with this many victims usually take years to get to trial. Great job prosecution!",
        "He spent more time bashing sue opper than he did on almost anything else\ufe0f not surprising at all. He apologizes to the judge and then five mins later does the exact tin* he apologizes for. He had no regard, regret, remorse towards the victims. Only that he got caught. Much love and support to the families and victims \ufe0f\ufe0f\ufe0f\ufe0f",
        "Of all the people in the courtroom, Sue Opper was the COURTROOM! Her and her team were amazing.",
        "He LITERALLY had the nerve, when asked what he think he should get, to say \u201cI mean, I have been here a year already\u201d - Never Relax.",
        "DA's closing statement was moving and powerful.\nDA team job well done.",
        "Judge Dorow, Sue Opper, and her team will forever live in my heart!",
        "Love her and can't wait to see her as a judge.",
        "She really did a wonderful job. Her and the entire defense team. She\u2019s an emotionally and mentally strong and wise woman.",
        "Everyone: you plowed into a parade full of innocent people, including a large proportion of children, murdering four grandmas, a grandpa, and a little boy. There\u2019s no way we could possibly come to hate you more than we already do. \nDarrell Brooks: hold my beer",
        "... the whole nation and the world!",
        "The judge!!",
        "These are the women young girls and young women should be seeing in there social media feeds. Rockstars.",
        "Great job!! Woot woot",
        "Everyone in this case did a great job, I cant wait for Brooks to meet his new husband in prison!",
        "The DEFENDANT ",
        "I fell asleep 2x during his pity monologue.  His insulting the DA. was typical of his trying to demean people who are on to him.  I almost believed some of his crap till I heard the jail house calls...he is worse than I thought. The jury found him guilty without knowing his priors and seeing alot of his antics in court. Major kudos to the prosecution (all of them), and the judge!",
        "The most powerful sentencing statement, ever. Along with Prosecutors closing arguments.  May those families start to heal. You all have tremendous strength. Those victims will never be forgotten.",
        "Wonderful counselor!!!!! Now, may your community begin to heal!!!! Awesome that a woman presided over the case and a female prosecutor tried the case!!!!! Awesome ",
        "How about that when theyre transformed as the imposter role, their voice is disguised, so they can still talk, but the crewmates dont know who it is.",
        "He thought he was going to get off.",
        "Her and her team, and the judge all did amazing work, and this guy got everything he deserved. Unfortunately, Wisconsin is not a death sentence state, because if anybody deserved it, this guy did",
        "Thank you for all the work you\u2019ve done to put that incel away for life. Justice has been served.",
        "Congratulations to the prosecution team",
        "LESBIAN!",
        "I want to go to the parade this year",
        "Love Sues accent.",
        "...and you madam prosecutor,  you all did fantastic, THANK YOU!",
        "The most hilarious part of the day was when the man in orange prison garb who was handcuffed and chained to the table told Sue Opper that she's not very bright.",
        "Bravo Sueyou did  everyone very proud ",
        "Had any of the previous courts saw the pattern of behavior of the defendant, the carnage of that day could have been avoided because he would have been incarcerated appropriately. Ponder that.",
        "The prosecutors did such a great job on this case",
        "Thank you Sue for the wonderful job you and others did to get this sociopath off of the streets! I hope you all get a nice,  long,  and well deserved vacation. God bless you all! ",
        "Too bad they\u2019ve done away with the death penalty!",
        "Sue is such a wonderful attorney. Great job by all of these attorneys. The clearly care so deeply for the victims and families they represented. \nJudge Dorow is incredible.",
        "I guess Nicole Linton is next",
        "What a nightmare for all of them and what strength was shown",
        "She needs to stop smiling, that's a disgrace to rejoice over someone getting life in prison. ",
        "DA Opper is an amazing woman. Truly a great prosecution team!",
        "Thank you to Sue Opper and Judge Dorow, they showed the world how conduct yourself in court and in life. It is all so emotional and tragic, my condolences to the families.",
        "Attorney Opper should be our attorney general. Her team did a great job with an excellent leader.",
        "Thank you both, Judge Dorow and Attorney Opper!",
        "What amazing people the judge and prosecution were. Justice in its purest form.",
        "I absolutely love Charlie, always going out of his way and doing everything he can to help people in any way possible whether it's with money, with a silly competition, a serious stream to promote exposure but still being silly to make people jus laugh, a charity stream or just something as simple as streaming to thousands of viewers every day making us all laugh and constantly putting smiles on her faces. I don't know about you guys but that sure does a lot for me  thank you charlie, for just simply being new",
        "Sue is now known as the Opper Stopper",
        "I absolutely LOVE Opper! She's amazing!",
        "Great job DA.  1000 Years for that POS!  RIP to victims, prayers to families and friends.",
        "His denial, delay, and narcissist pathological behaviors is soooo very similar to DJT, it remarkable. Brooks will never make it through his sentence due to his narcissism.  His fellow inmates won't put up with it coupled it with the fact that vons don't like people who kill and/or maime children. I don't expect Brooks to survive their wrath.",
        "They did a great job!",
        "I knew a black girl named Waukeesha once.",
        "This lady right here...I love her!",

        "Amazing prosecution team on this case.    Very good at their job!!  They did their best to keep calm & keep going.",
        "As a Waukesha resident I am so proud of Judge Darrow. How she dealt with DB and giving respect to all the victims by naming them during the first six homicide convictions was nothing short of amazing.",
        "Great job.",
        "after seeing brooks mom and grandma and what they had to say it's no wonder he's a demon. I wonder if they remembered he killed 6 and injured 61",
        "This lady did a fantastic job and showed the narcassist that he wasnt going to control or manipulate her . He hated the sight of her but she couldnt care less. Q very strong and powerful lady. God bless her.",
        "If for some odd reason I woke up one day and was told I did this and here's the evidence, I would be apologetic and lay my fate on the judgment of the court. His behavior, on the other hand, shows not the slightest amount of remorse.",
        "Can barely hear the reporters",
        "I was so angered that he never once apologized, and rolled his eyes and clapped his hands ",
        "Address why he did this. Address the black supremacists social media that defined his life.",
        "Lord dont u know as long as he breaths hes walkin free even if its in prison thats more than he gave those peopl he killed",
        "Sue Opper and her team did a damn good job for his victims and their families.\nJudge Dorow is most gracious and she is the Patron Saint of Patience.\ufe0f\nLove to Waukesha",

        "DAMN THIS WOMAN IS HARD TO LOOK AT!\nWILL IT HOLD UP ON APPEAL?",
        "What a crybaby she is so unprofessional.",
        "Because he thinks he shouldn't be punished at all, that's why he had no answer for her.",
        "Fantastic prosecution team",
        " Sue Opper ",
        "Also, I thought the victims, judge and lawyers were amazing and really reflected the quality of their community.",
        "Great job all around.",

        "Sue Oppor you are amazing  ",
        "She did an amazing job",
        "Job well done by all!! \nSo much love for all the victims and there family's. I truly hope they can all heal from this someday and learn to live life without fear. The victims statements were so heartbreaking and I am so glad the judge addressed them as she did. ",
        "Well done  Justice served! My condolences to all the victims of injuries and the families and loved ones of the people who were murdered. God Bless ",
        "DA Opper....you did a phenomenal job.",
        "I love this lady... she's able to clearly articulate herself even under this stress and emotional strain.",
        "Justice has been served for these families.",
        "From Florida: First, Bless Waukesha citizens, My deepest sympathy to you all.  Congratulation to the Prosecution Team, Judge Dorow, and Jury.   This is a trial I watched from beginning to end with very little knowledge of the incident with just headline internet news last year.  I certainly didn't know Darrell Brooks.  I became interested as I was in a jury select case for a major murder case in Broward County but was dismissed due to health reasons but it was an intriguing process to me.  Well, I learned a lot within this case in regards to Sovereign nonsense, a raging maniac that is not insane.  Gosh, I got in a lot of arguments with friends stating that he's simply an evil man with no good intentions period.  I wished I followed earlier because I would've loved to be there tomorrow and stand strong with the community.  You are all in my heart!  AGAIN, THANK YOU JUDGE DOROW, SUE OPPER/TEAM AND JURY.",
        "God bless you Sue and the rest of your team!You  all did an AMAZING JOB!!Did you see Zachary white knuckling the arm of the chair when Brooks was talking! It took everything in him not to jump up and punch that SOB!!",
        "Animals belong in a cage.",
        "The closest to an apology he got was, \"Not only am I sorry for what happened, I'm sorry you could not see what is truly in my heart\" That was not an apology, that was minimization. He is distancing himself from the crime he committed with the language he's using. If he was sincerely apologetic and taking accountability it would have been, \"I am sorry for what I did\" and that's the bare minimum.. as in, if he felt even slightly bad for the hurt he caused others then that's how he'd have worded it. Then he goes on to blame the victims for not being able to decipher his remorse. He says they're comfortable hearing what they want to hear. This man is an unscratchable itch under my skin, I can't imagine how the victims and family must feel. He regrets his actions alright, but not because of the damage, suffering, and death he caused... he regrets his actions because he doesn't like his consequences.",

She's set to retire in 2024 at the end of her term, and it's more than well earned.\nJudge Dorow was equally compassionate, giving Brooks all the patience and discretion she could muster, yet going above and beyond to protect the record, and not mincing words when saying how she felt. She was compassionate toward those who truly suffer from NGI-resulting mental illness, and to the 68+ victims. ",

        "Did you notice the people that spoke on Darrell Brooks behalf? Never really said anything good about him except for the ex-girlfriend. His mom and grandmother went straight into mental illness pep talk. They never said. I love you Darrell. I'm sorry this happened. It was just basically mental health hurts. This and mental health does this. And then it was. I've been a pastor for 47 years and we've done this and we've done that and I'm going to make it my job to do this. Well okay. The past 47 years of trying to help your community. Why couldn't you guys get help for your son? He wouldn't even take responsibility for what he did.

She was bright enough to put him away for 6 life sentences, plus almost 1,100 years and every dime he makes in prison will be taken away for restitution. Congratulations Sue Opper and your team. Shout out to Judge Jennifer Dorow for the way she handled the courtroom. She did an amazing job and dealt out the proper sentencing. Prayers for all the victims in this case.

So very thankful to them and the entire prosecution team and every witness who went through this trial with the patience of saints in order to put away such a horrible, conscienceless human being. Brooks tried to make a mockery of the system and had no regard for the lives lost, but Judge Jennifer Dorow gave such an amazing tribute to the victims in her closing remarks and sentencing. You can really feel how much love is in this community. I hope they all continue to find strength in each other.",

I've seen scummy managers do this exact bs maneuver all the time to employees that they don't like; give them a completely unrealistic schedule, expect them to work insane overtime, only to berate them when they inevitably fail so that they can call them \"lazy\" and have an excuse to fire them. My heart sank when I read Mick's statement and saw this kind of abuse happening to him. When reading Marty's post vs Mick's it's clear to me who the real \"ball ache\" is. Marty's post reads exactly like a corporate rat who knows he holds all the power and can control the narrative with the help of his massive legal team. :-D",

There must be some kind of rules of the Court that can limit a free for all approach by the Defendant. I did not realize that the Court is required to guide the Defendent through the process and provide him with so much written material.Darrell Brooks made my skin crawl with his ignorance and narcissistic behavior. Judge Dorow chose what she felt was the best way to handle Brooks behavior, but it became a game Brooks controlled. What a torturous daily grind for every member of the Court and all observers.

        "For certain, this was a victory and justice was finally served after allowing Brooks to disrespect the victims and the court each and every day of the trial and allowing his ego to bask in the focus of the spotlight of everyone's attention while he did it.  What is still rather upsetting, however, is the idea that he was a free man to commit the atrocious act of mowing down all of those people in that parade, after already demonstrating to the world that he was a danger to society by way of his documented history of crime and violent crimes, including running over his ex with the same vehicle not long before doing the same thing to all of the victims in this case.  I can not wrap my mind around how many times this sorry excuse for a man kept finding himself in custody due to his inability to conduct himself like a emotionally stable, adult, but then to have the legal system release him with minimal consequences!  The most basic of algorithms would have flagged this man as an inevitable threat to society!  Somebody in the legal system over there has the blood of these, many victims on their hands for failing to hand down the appropriate punishment to Darrel Brooks each time he was cycled through the courts, arrest after arrest after arrest.  That person (or those people) must know who they are and I pray that they fully realize how their inaction allowed this to happen and I sure hope they handle future cases accordingly so another easily identifiable monster, well on his way to committing such an atrocity is prevented from doing so by holding them accountable to their initial crimes, getting them off the streets before they can do maximum damage to their communities!",

        "I so wish the media would discontinue any coverage on Brooks.  He received Constitutional privileges which appeared more like enabling due to his despicable behavior.  Now they need to put him away.  No appeal will be forthcoming and the victims should take preeminence in this Country.",
        "God bless sue opper",
        "He wasn't delivering a sentence recommendation; he was filibustering to stall the imposition of sentence.  He has repeatedly turned himself inside out to avoid anything that even remotely looked like responsibility.\nAlso, I'm glad he didn't apologize.  The victims, and indeed the greater Waukesha community, doesn't deserve to be subjected to an obscene parody of remorse.  He's only sorry he got caught so quickly.",
        "Prosecutor's did a great job",
        "Hope you have a great parade this year",
        "Taunting disrespecting and intimidating a judge that has the responsibility of sentencing you in case where you murdered 6 people in front of thousands of people is the definition of ignorance.",

        "I have so much respect for miss Opper and the judge Does anyone know if it's possible to write a letter to them? And if so ..how?",
        "Job well done!!!",
        "She is Smart, Intelligent, professional, great job !!!!!!!",
        "I completely agree with this man's sentence. He's pure evil. But the judge shouldn't have allowed them to clap and applause. Even the massively long 4 hour sentencing from the judge was possibly going to far. The guy deserves it all, but that stuff can be used to his advantage on appeal, to say the judge was prejudiced against him. Morally, what she did was right, but from a legal standpoint, I don't think it was a good idea.",
        "Love how she says 'our families'",
        "His entire 2 hour speech was a self-pity party.\nHe took his mask off solely to try and pull heart strings with his sad face.\nThe day before he had it on so he could laugh at his victims.\nThankyou Judge Dorow for not being swayed, and for making sure he has absolutely no basis for any type of valid appeal.",

        "Judge Dorow blew me away. I've never had a judge bring tears to my eyes reading out a sentence. She was absolutely brilliant. What a woman. Waukesha is lucky to have her.",
        "Tremendous drain on all with boots on the ground. Thank you to all participants. ",
        "When he told the Judge to consider time served, I was lik, WHAT!? R u serious?",
        "But Sue NEVER proved subject matter jurisdiction of the lawful law. Incompetence shouldn\u2019t be rewarded with tv coverage.",

        "This woman truly is a queen!!!! She handled this case with absolute grace!!!!  ",
        "One of the best things about Attorney Opper\u2019s excellent work on this case was how she allowed Judge Dorow the room to she needed, but also stuck up for the court at times saying what Judge Dorow could not say.",
        "Sue is a real life hero in my opinion. It had to have been an extremely heavy weight on her heart to do all she could to obtain justice for all the victims. She did it with such class, integrity, & warmth. That combined with her work ethic & determination were deeply inspiring.",
        "Thank you Sue Opper great Job for the Job you did .Thank you for helping put this dangerous Man behind bars .Thank you to you and Judge Jennifer Dorow for getting this Narristisistic Ass off the streets for the rest of his life ..",
        "She a great prosecutor joan of Arc",
        "Even if your slightly annoyed by how OP this team was, you gotta admit that having the whole game team against them at the end was way more entertaining then if it had been a normal tournament.",

        "Sue Opper - you are an amazing attorney and I loved the fact that you held your composure in the face of Brook's insane disrespect for weeks, and then when you told him to \"Sit down and Be quiet\" during the final day of sentencing a huge smile came across my face! He deserved that from you, obviously. And I'm glad you said what you did to him in that moment.",
        "Judge Dorow not only gave the families justice, but she probably saved many more lives by getting that evil off the streets.",
        "Love her...shes a rock!!",
        "DA Sue Opper & her team, the Epitome of Professionalism, Humanity & Patience rolled up into ONE Voice for Justice in Waukesha!!\n  My presence on the DA Team would have reduced Brooks to a smoldering pool of smegma on the floor of the Courtroom. However, my sarcasm would have violated the rules of Decorum & rendered me in my own \"Time out\" room!!",
        "I can see where he gets is babble talk from he spent 2 hrs talking about nothing to hear himself\u2026 and his mother and grandmother did the same thing..they didn\u2019t say anything about him at all..",

To DB's family, I pray you educate yourselves and come to the realization that DB's actions where NOT a result of mental health issues and please stop using that as an excuse as it belittles those with REAL mental health issues. DB just feels he's above the law and he's entitled to do whatever he wants to, and as his family you have seen this pattern of behaviour, so stop making excuses for him and take accountability for it.  As for DB himself, well you're just not worth my time and my hope is you're taught in jail that you need to earn respect, not demand it and are finally humbled.",
        "The judge allowed him to speak for two hours and not one word of an apology whatsoever. After all charges were read, so thorough, she got his ass out of her town that night. He looked so pitiful. Get the f out. His future is over. No money,no life. Judge your diligence alone commands respect for the judicial system, nation wide. Much respect.",

THAT HE never answered her directly, I watched his whole two hour rambling.  He did answer asking first for clarification what the words were again, then said concurrent (or close to that).

She and her team dealing with an IMPOSSIBLE defendant, Brooks had a HUGE VENDETTA against her, because she told the truth about his MISTAKE LIFE!! She had a job to do and he HATED that he couldn't hurt her with his words, and I'm sure he wanted to PHYSICALLY hurt her!! He hated that she wouldn't argue with him. When you ignore a narcissist they CAN'T HANDLE IT!! IGNORING NARCISSISTS IS THE ONLY THING THEY HATE!!",

        "Darrell Brooks tried to make this entire trial about him and his precious feelings.  This court went more than the extra mile making sure that Brooks received the fair, impartial trial that he is due under the AMERICAN legal system, but also remembered that VICTIMS HAVE RIGHTS TOO that so many courts across the US forget or ignore while catering to individuals like Mr Brooks.  THIS must end.",
        "She a great job . Brooks thought he was going only get 10 - 15 years. When he realized his ship was sunk he wasn\u2019t \u201ca man of God\u201d anymore. He\u2019s going to be a big pain in the A$$ no matter where he is housed.",

I\u00b4m from M\u00e9xico but i saw the news and keep watching the whole trial, so annoying, so disgusting that this guy is just pure evil, hope he rot in jail.
