        "Now don't misunderstand me here. Willem Defoe is brilliant, and part of his brilliance, I think, was honed early on by his in-depth work with the Wooster Group. He allows huge theatricality in his performances without losing an iota of believability or tension. Few actors can achieve that level of performance. It draws you in to his incredibly complex psyche. The Lighthouse, for example. Asking another lesser actor to go those physical extremes would probably look just ridiculous, but not with Willem Defoe.",

        "Willem Dafoe lost my respect when he did that Van Gogh movie.  I really thought he would do a wonderful job,  I'm telling you, I did.  No serious actor would ever play the role he did with that script... it was an insult to Van Gogh, they made him look ignorant about his own faith.  Van Gogh was a Christian, and a minister, and in the film they just had lies and lies come out of Van Gogh's mouth about Jesus Christ... having Willem saying \"no one even knew Jesus existed until He died, and not one word was said about Him\".. that isn't true at all.  Jesus had people following Him by the thousands... There's literally testimony after testimony about it all over the New Testament.  Willem Dafoe should be ashamed, if he really cared about a character he played he would study what that person believed and who they were.. and dig deep, especially for an artist that impactful.  People didn't even know how famous an artist could be until Vincent Van Gogh... the most famous and influential artist who ever lived, and Willem didn't even bother studying what Van Gogh actually believed in.  Imagine being an actor who can put out any movie and it will be worth millions of dollars and you don't even bother studying someone like Van Gogh... let alone study Jesus Christ, the most influential person who ever lived! The person Van Gogh believed in!  How can you be that big of an actor and make that big of a mistake.. Just pure Hollywood pride and arrogance.  I don't care what you believe, if you were in a movie about Justin Bieber or Chance The Rapper would you have him say \"I don't know anything about Jesus\"? Of course not!  If you wanted it to be a good movie you'd open up a bible and find out what that influential artist believes in, especially if you're going to talk about it in the movie!",
