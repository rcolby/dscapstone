        "Since its a scooby the progressive curve $300 should win on that point as its a classic WRC car",
        "I love this series but have a suggestion for the next season. What about y'all change the concept a bit and use the same quality parts but one newer more expensive vehicle and one older more beat up vehicle. Same make and models just different years and mileage.",

        "\"But now, with the war finally over, I'm free.\"\nThis quote holds such a different meaning now. I remember hearing it for the first time and thinking about how it added an almost humorous flare of drama to the video at the end. Now I hear it and hold back tears. I still can't tell whether they're tears of joy or sadness. Of course it wasn't meant to hold the meaning it does now, it was just about a videogame where he was fighting for a rank. For honor. Not for his life. Not a war with cancer. But Alex, the man behind the screen, the man giving us this content and joy, is now free. Which is a happy thing, even is it's hard for the people who he made smile in his life. And as for Technoblade... Technoblade never dies.",

        "Just Subaru things",
        "Like everyone else seems to be saying. The production quality and overall skill you guys have as a team to make content and deliver time and time again really breaks my heart that you don't have a TV show that you have at least enough control over to write your own scripts and make your own mini series as you've been doing here just on television as well!",

        "Adding the segment with the diagnostics on the parts you're using was very cool and informative. Loved it. Glad you guys are evolving content and not just doing the same thing every time. Good stuff fellas.",
        "Good show like everything\u2026.. except that you changed the tries as well wish it was only the suspension that got switched",
        "I blame the motor blowing up on the monotube coilovers.",
        "Preload can only lower your ride height if you preload more weight than is on the spring from the car itself.",
        "Nolan is a pro driver  proud of you son ",
        "Ate we sure these are 2005 WRXs? This headlight style wasn't released until 2006.",
        "Anybody else notice that they pulled a set of KYB AGX\u2019s with upgraded springs (FANTASTIC suspension combo) out of low car to put in the equivalent to hot dogs instead?",
        "I didn't even know this was a hi-lo series, I think the title could use some work lol",
        "I have the same yellow coil overs on my coup it drives great",
        "Better suspension, better traction, better lap times. Papa Nolan\u2019s",
        "You guys need to add mid car!",
        "6:51 With that headshot you are the perfect person to cast in a live action version of Wreck It Ralph. ",
        "You're gonna tell me they can afford all of these cars, mods, production crew etc. But cant afford professional timing equipment? Why are they using an iphone stopwatch?\ufe0f",
        "These cars are not identical.",
        "Anyone else notice the video and editing team really upped their game in this video? The lapse of the old coil over coming undone step by step was a great segment",
        "Nice, but i suppose that tires of cars have a diferent manufacturing date, so their specification are also diferent.",
        "what midpriced coilovers would you guys recommend for a smooth ride? the Maxspeeding ones were way too stiff and felt very bumpy. i like a smooth ride",
        "2:11 casualy Nolan or some one else dying working on the car lol",
        "Have you guys ever watched dragon ball? The guy with three eyes is named Tein pronounce them like his name \ufe0f",
        "Definitely buy the expensive coilovers.",
        "Ugh those cars are so Damn nice \ud83e\udee0",
        "Is nobody talking about the cpr session at 2:20 ?",
        "The reason the cars keep failing is because people beat the shit out of them new till they are scrap.",
        "I feel like we\u2019ve been here before",
        "You keep saying max speeding rods. They\u2019re max Peeding rods.",
        "James claiming his signed headshots are worth $1200 is hilarious. If it's a joke it's well written. If it was supposed to be true then its even funnier that he actually said that out loud ",
        "When a YT vid starts out with a simple math error that a 5 year old USA child 2 generations ago could figure out with his fingers, the credibility is shot for the rest of the vid and channel. If you can't figure out simple math,---there really is not much you can figure out.  Sue your schools.",
        "to see more!",
        "In fairness to James, his times are the only with 2 people in the car.",
        "Do you have any idea how much I appreciate that this channel only takes on sponsors that will allow them to write their own ad read",
        "Slick editing! That bit where Zack is explaining how coil-over replacement works was really excellent.",
        "Next video idea who can build a better engine cheap vs expensive parts",
        "This guys are slowly but steadily generating a (classic) top gear vibe with their interactions between themselves. Congrats",
        "I put maxspeeding rods coilovers on my 12 mazda3 and they are absolute junk, 500lb spring rate springs on the rear-end of a lightweight car make for a bone jarring ride, granted it's not as bad now that I've got the rear shocks adjusted right, but still. I regret not spending the extra money for a good quality set of coilovers.",
        "Low-key appreciate the low lift joke.",
        "Wait did you guys just launch a new season of high low and not even make a big deal about it???",
        "i can't wait to see all of the engine failures they have.",
        "This series has changed my life so much that I now answer the phone by saying \"HiLow\" instead of \"hello\".",
        "To beat you I gotta improve me",
        "Up north here there's no way those are coming out that easy lol.",
        "Love the new cars and especially as it\u2019s my fav gen of Subaru. \n\nAlso I assume it will be a long long way off but I thinks something like a bmw z3 would be a cool out of the box idea for a hi low series",
        "blown motor on a subaru?....nooo",
        "Wouldnt be a Subaru video without a blown engine!",
        "I love the return of this series, and I love how well constructed, informativce and entertaining they are. You guys seem to genuinely love making videos, and I can't get enough. Well done guys!!!!!",
        "Never get rid of High vs Low. This series is by far my favorite car series on YouTube",
        "I love how they get to basically have father-daughter time and it's almost adorable seeing them do this. The text is magical and just you know it's Ethan. You know he's protecting her the best he can and it makes it so touching cuz he sees himself in her with how stubborn she is.",
        "I like how the guys are wearing gold chains now lol",
        "Im about 98% sure tein is pronounced \"Tee-in\"",
        "Please EBay motors how many fake parts do they sell like spark plugs fuel injectors Sure the price looks good but if it destroys your motor is it worth it then ? Maybe the reason that motor in the high car keeps failing is because of all those eBay Chinese parts that`s in it",
        "Typical Subaru am i right guys",
        "Subaru problems lmao ",
        "2k and still buys garbage teins coilovers lmao.",
        "subaru has the best blue",
        "Wouldn't be a Subaru video without some blown Engines lol.....",
        "low car should be doing the mods the hard way! OG in a driveway with a single jack and jack stands!",
        "went off track. but at least their rally cars lol.. i think both cars should've had the same driver",
        "I need that shock dyno right now ",
        "The ending crack me up! Lol",
        "Donut artificially raises cool car prices with every new series",
        "2:17 as much of a gem this bit is, I can only imagine how much better it'd be if they did the \"CPR Twerk\"",
        "Jesus, yall got something great here. I've been watching car shows for literally over 30 years and this show even after only 5 minutes I connected to like that once in a lifetime feeling ya know! This show, the guys the excitement of it WOW!",
        "Coo",
        "What do you define as one deviation better? Then we can figure out how much better these shocks are :D",
        "Hi-Lo = Amazeballs!! An awesome twist would be to see Pumphrey on Low team one of these days and Nolan be on hi team  :)",
        "new hilow ?",
        "just dont buy maxspeedingjunk coilovers.",
        "Was the blue subi low on oil? Lol",
        "I love these compression viseo but you should do them will making low budget use low budget tools And high budget with the expensive tools (proper tools).",
        "You're basically done with the tutorial, Zeta. Once you've been given the three story paths you can explore the world how you like!\nDid pretty well for a first time. Have a good rest!",
        "Well I had 1995 \u0160koda Felicia 1.3 BMM (look for that car on internet) as my first car, used one from Germany and it had lowered KW set of coilovers for 800 USD in that time... Was it worth it? Nope, I once got stuck in a puddle, as my front was too low... then I had Seat Cordoba SX 1.8 16v (130+hp) with Bilstein coilover for 1500 USD... Was it worth it? HELL YEAH on nice new roads. Problem is, here in Czechia (Czech Republic), roads are still like in eastern block, so total thrash, pot holes everywhere. So you had to change everything around the coilovers every half a year.",
        "why didnt you make much comment about the ride quality/comfort between the 2",
        "Nothing",
        "this testing method is much more enjoyable and feels like more reliable information",
        "LETS GO!!! SUBIIIIIIIIIIII",
        "Those tiens had linear valving, not digressive. Also theyre just a decent entry product from a trust worthy company, not a high end option. Also the rods demo that showed them bouncing around os over-dampened is the opposite of true, the problem is gunna be that the spring wont be able to put the wheel back down fast enough after a bump bcs the damping is strong for it, as well the damper generating a too large portion of the compression resistance, meaning undue wear and heating of the oil in the damper. Finally, it will mean a jarring ride.",
        "im confused,  is this the first episode to these wrx'es? they should separate series of episodes of hi low for every car",
        "I'm glad to finally see the WRX get some love in this serries. I just lost mine to an unfortunate accident (Not my faults). Feels good to see them here.",
        "\"Cuz it's low lift\" ",

        "Low car 1 - High car 0 in reliability",
        "No one\u2019s going to talk about the whole installing coil overs sequence?",
        "I got cheap coilovers off Amazon for my Mazda3. I knew it was a bad idea then and boy was I right. First, quality was very cheap, ride noise increased incredibly. Handling did improve but eff they are stiff. Way more stuff than any other coil over I've ever seen. And the front coilovers  started leaking fluid within 4 months and were gone by 6.",
        "You guys did flawlessly with this video.   the editing bringing all the ideas together. Using the full team's perspective to ensure the idea of why you'd wanna do this replacement yourself. And just how well you have all grown so naturally into your position. If every video has this quality of personal touch,  this will be the best season hi-lo has ever seen",
        "6:13 most likely if there is only one adjustment its bound.  Rebound is more about matching your springs and wheel weight, any decent shock maker can get you close on rebound.  Bound has the most control over handling and ride comfort so likely any shock that is single adjustable is going to be bound.",
        "Sooo sooo SOOO EXCITED FOR A NEW SEASON OF HI LOW!!! Guys y'all are so much more knowledgeable and experienced since the 350z days. Impressed how y'all grown in this industry since the OG days. Even the quality and editing of videos is better. Thank y'all for doing another season ",
        "Y\u2019all was out in the Av man I hope I run into you guys one day!",
        "Lmao subie special one definitely had to blow up ",
        "6:20 this is why you should match up new parts mounting with the old stuff before you get too far ahead of yourself.",
        "I mean\u2026 y\u2019all chose Subarus\u2026 those engines love to blast at 100K\u2026",
        "When @zack said \u201ccojenes\u201d I liked",
        "get jimmy on camera if he can talk.",
        "2:18 ",
        "I might watch Baby Driver again after this",
        "Really showing all sides of Subaru. A real blast, literally.",
        "The cinematographer and story boarding are really good in this episode.",
        "Lift sounds like it needs a oil change",
        "2:18 lmaoo",
        "18 track days at 400whp in my miata and only problems have been very minor. \nTypical Subaru, engine blown!",

        "You forgot to put eggs in the coolant!",
        "So Tein is still entry level.. fortune autos, KW and Ohlins are the best from what I\u2019ve seen. You\u2019re comparing $300 coils to $700 coils in this video lol",
        "lmao good ol subaru reliability strikes high car haha",
        "I will say the production value of this video is fantastic. Not that previous High/Low was bad, but this is a huge step forward.",
        "Congrats on the sponsor!  These videos are very well written, produced and edited.  It\u2019s been great watching this channel grow and it looks like you guys are in the zone.",
        "Tein? Really? Shoulda bought Cygnus. Same money, way better.",
        "ITS BACK WITH SUBARUS",
        "It seems you will have to change the engine several times",
        "Its feels so good to have thia series back! This is so entertaining! Thanks Donut !",
        "Aw man you guys got shaftworks to help dyno but you should have had him review your video. There are a few errors you should shoot him an email",
        "They blew the motor while testing? That\u2019s the most Subaru thing I\u2019ve ever heard",
        "I am so immeasurably happy that im getting the OG hi lo vibe from this and it is getting me really hyped to mod my car more, it is also inspiring me and making me happy to be in the car scene. Thank you donut media love you forever and always!!!",
        "Awesome cars for the series! Love the content.",

        "Hilarious that the subarus had problems immediately",
        "Forgot how much I love this series ",
        "From personal experience best bang for your buck just buy quality stiff coil springs and fit them to cheap coilover shocks and you\u2019ll achieve same ride quality as expensive coilovers.",
        "i have an 07 impreza wagon and it's given me so many problems. mainly wheel bearings",
        "Glad you guys did this but you just did cheap coil overs vs overpriced cheap coil overs. Wish you had done fancy ones that had been custom built like MCS, pensky or Motons to see the real difference in having real race suspension vs off the shelf stuff.",
        "Best Hi Lo video so far. It's meticulously put together and delivers great information at the perfect rate, super engaging. Looking at the episode lengths, I think it could easily be ported from YouTube to TV if a channel is up for it, it'd be better than most car shows that currently air.",
        "Thank you, Techno, for making my childhood so much better.\n\nRest in Peace, Potato King.",
        "About 10 years ago I had put tein lowering springs on my 2007 Impreza and then swapped them with BC coilovers.  This hit close to home lol",

        "Good stuff",
        "Should have driven the Hi Car first and then the Low Car. This can be bias as you have more seat time and gotten used to the track more.",
