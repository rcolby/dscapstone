        "How would kartana be able to cut guzzlord once it\u2019s inside the if he\u2019s a black hole, him being able to cut \u201canything\u201d isn\u2019t even valid since he wouldn\u2019t be able to move or even survive inside guzzlord",
        "Man I was sure Kartana had this in the bag, I swore it was gonna slice open Naganadel\u2019s stinger and it was gonna blow itself up, but I guess not",

        "Kartana beating Celesteela in the context of the animation makes zero sense. Kartana is made of a paper-like substance, so the combustion of Celesteela's rockets, if potent enough to burn down an entire forest and the distant Xurkitree, it should absolutely decimate Kartana for getting near it, and especially for approaching from below. Not the mention the amount of force being exerted for the take-off, Kartana, being ones of the lightest things ever, should be thrown back and unable to even make any head-way from that angle. Heck, Kartana being so light probably shouldn't be able to get that high into the atmosphere even without the Celesteela there, considering how powerful winds get. And, you could argue that Kartana is closer to steel than paper, so it wouldn't burn up, but it would definitely soften it and thus weaken the cutting power of its blades significantly.",

This is the most important thing you'll ever hear in your life. Jesus is coming back soon! God sent His only Begotten Son into the world, that whosoever shall believe on Him shall not perish but have eternal life. Those who do not believe will be condemned. (John 3:16-18). Jesus died for our sins, and to set us free from our sins and condemnation (John 8:36, Acts 13:39). Jesus rose from the the grave 3 days later after His death, defeating death. He now lives forevermore, and seeing we have saving faith in Him,  we too will live eternally with Him! Jesus is the only way to Heaven (John 14:6). Following Him is the best decision to make in life. Though the Christian life isn't a life absent of difficulty, despite any circumstance Jesus gives true peace and fulfillment, a peace and fulfillment this world cannot give (John 14, John 16).",

        "Fun fact, in the early days of Ultra Sun and Moon, of course with the new mons still being tested, they were all of course put into OU. Bad idea, as Naganadel's only counter in that tier and format was Heatran, who resisted both STABs and also trapped it. However if you didn't know, Naganadel has Nasty Plot, meaning it can even brute force a win against it by just setting up enough. I love this guy, not to mention its shiny is awesome. It even has one of my favorite moves, Fell Stinger, though of course not something it would ever use seriously as it's a special attacker.",

Steel resists Poison which is why Kartana had to go out that way via an explosion otherwise Kartana would win being so small and agile and having the ability to cut anything in existence and being able to be immune to Neganadel\u2019s poison adhesive.

Personally I feel like it\u2019s one of the least popular Ultra Beasts (though it\u2019s kinda understandable cus it\u2019s 4x weak to fire). According to the Kartana\u2019s official description, it can form tiny ultra wormholes by feverishly slicing into space & time itself, so that moment when Guzzlord devoured it was so funny cus I knew instantly it was gonna be sliced in half internally. I know that Naganadel technically won, but that final kill slice basically secured Kartana\u2019s victory in my opinion, albeit at a fatal cost.",
        "Guzzlord should win when they swallow them.. How would Kartana cut thru infinity..",
        "So, why exactly was Kartana not able to outrun the explosion at the end? Kartana seemed to avoid being slowed down or otherwise immobilized by the glue, and he both dodged Naganadel's intended laser and sliced the needle. Was there something to confirm that damaging Naganadel's needle would create an explosion that exceeded Kartana's maximum speed, and that said explosion wouldn't kill Naganadel via brain damage?",

It's bottom end was cut clean open and exploded..which is where it's brain is so it should be dead; and the \"glue\" shouldn't have any effect on a steel type like Kartana (it's toxic liquid, while it maybe possibly could stick to Kartana it wouldn't do any damage), also why would it of exploded?! Justice for Kartana! Cheating my boi out of a deserved win.",
        "that i want wings to from mom was adorable",
        "#1 on trending?",
        "I feel like if Kartana and Naganadel fought right off the bat the same way Kartana woulda won",
        "6:28 I guess you could say it's the only thing he's ever known. GUITAR RIFF  SIEROMEM NEKORB EHT HTUHRT SEOG NEKOPSNU!",
        "Nah see I'm just mad that Guzzlord didn't win.  When they sucked up Naganadel and Kartana, as they described it, Guzzlord used a \"black hole like\" method, which would supposedly destroy anything it sucks up.  To move faster than a black hole, Kartana would have to move faster than light itself, correct?  Especially because it was already in the black hole, as it was already inside Guzzlord.  Therefore, since Kartana may be fast -- but not above light speed in my opinion -- it should not have been able to slice Guzzlord in half and thus should not have won.",
        "5:28 Source?\nAlso, I didn't find anything in Poipole's Pokedex entries about it being adhesive. Is that extrapolating from its evolved form's abilities? Or an anime thing? Same question about the brain in stinger thing, is there any evidence for that beyond assuming from body structure?",
        "Wouldn't Kartana be immune to poison bc steel?",
        "Y'all remember where Kartana tried to cut up a rainbow?",
        "2:41 reminded me of \u201dThe Cube\u201d",
        "Not gonna lie, the big shots opening caught me off guard for a second.",
        "Also hal 9000.",
        "1:09 EHEHEHEHEH! Ohhh the anime was hilarious.\n6:12 Pheramosa needs scissors...SIXTY ONE!!!\n7:03 Being part steel type, Poison cannot marr it's surface. But the flame of a blast, it cannot survive.",
        "Where's Solgaleo and Lunala?",
        "Fun fact, Guzzlord's voice is literally just an unedited sound of James' VA screaming.",
        "Doesn\u2019t explain why cartana didn\u2019t just kill negonodale",
        "Number 1 Trending!",
        "hopefully the next one is paradox mons",
        "Just watched\n\nkartana is crazy",
        "That\u2019s how guzzlers ate teh earth",
        "Buzzwole and Pheromosa should have teamed up as they have a tag team card too!",
        "*Kartana using Sams voice lines\nOh good. Why, that's very good yes I like that!",
        "I really want to see an Showdown with all the regional Pokemon...i mean different region forms",
        "For obvious reasons Necrozma, Solgaleo, Lunala and their pre-evolutions were not here",
        "I dont think that Lusamine borows her style from Pheromosa. It is the ultra beats themselves that are inspired from sun and moon characters",
        "\"5 Naganadel\" is a little misleading. You almost always play multiple of a Pokemon card in the card game, but that deck used two different types of Naganadel card for support. The TCG isn't particularly held to basing a card's power off of its Pokemon, though- Joltik was once the heaviest hitter around.",
        "I really enjoyed the The Snatcher reference in the Terminal Montage video when Nihilego possesses Pheromosa. It made me chuckle probably a bit more than it should.\nAlso I just like seeing A Hat in Time get more recognition even in silly little references like that laugh.",
        "Look, celesteela may not have won, but I choose to believe she survived, so I'm satisfied. Shame she didn't do much tho",
        "But wouldn't kartana not be damaged by poison as its a steel type?",
        "Guzlord: \u201cthe most powerful of all.\u201d\n\nNecrozma: am I a joke? I fought God!!",
        "We need to see Smii7y and the gang playing battles in Mario Kart before we die.",
        "Ahh yes, it gets sliced then blows up from the inside by its own shot, but still survives.",
        "Anyone know what kartana is saying throughout the video?",
        "I thought Kartana won?",
        "A quick question about Ultra Space or Pokemon from light-years away. Necrozma is said to be from an alternative universe (I think) so what would he be considered as?",
        "It's crazy that the entire time when I saw Kartana V Naganadel I exclaimed \"BUT IT'S IMMUNE TO POISON\". this might be true, but it does not stop glue from being glue in this anime-esque combat",
        "Congrats on #1 on trending!!!",
        "The second I heard that kartana's lines were Sam I got hyped",
        "1:17 Don\u2019t forget the Iron Giant reference when Xurkitree says \u201cHogarth?\u201d and lumbers towards the power plant!",
        "The only thing that I didn't liked was that he didn't adapted blacefalon's moonwalk from the anime",
        "If Phil Swift were a trainer, I'm pretty aire His Partner would be Naganadel",
        "Being neganedel is like being the kid in Fortnite who won 1st place through sheer luck despite being awful at the game.",
        "why did you not add cosmog evolution line",
        "Irrelevant to the video but I remember he made a joke once about how gamefreak isn\u2019t so lazy as to make a fire flamingo and call it FLAMEingo and like\u2026they just did. They didn\u2019t even change the color it just looks like a normal ass flamingo. Also a bunch of the new mons have name very similar to some of the lockemon names he\u2019s made.",
        "During the whole video I thought that pheromosa was going to take a little hit and she was going to die.",
        "Is it just me or does the color of the video get really weird?",
        "I\u2019m curious what your take will be on the leaked Paldean Terastal Legendary.",
        "Appreciate that you don't just explain what happens scene-by-scene, but also your reasoning for why certain pokemon did well overall in the fight. Another really fun Battle Royale!",
        "i always watch these first",
        "0:16 that's not how taxonomy would work but okay",
        "If you feel like nobody cares about you, go somewhere by yourself and kneel down to pray. Put your hands together and give your praise and prayer requests to Jesus! Jesus cares about you! He cares about mankind! Even though we as people can\u2019t see Jesus with our eyes, we know for a fact that GOD sees us with his. For it is written, \u201cThe eyes of the LORD are in every place, beholding the evil and the good.\u201d Proverbs 15:3 KJV ",

        "I just dont know how Guzzlord didn't that  guy is a walking black hole",
