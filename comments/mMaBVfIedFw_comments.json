        "I love how Michael\u2019s videos now feel exactly the same as they did 10 years ago.",
        "Still waiting on that episode about Xenophobia Michael.",
        "23:06 \n\nWell to be fair, Mike Tyson has been calling it that for years. ",
        "I know this is a little thing, but I can't describe to you how fun it is to analyze the 'before and after' of the various shots you posted. Thanks for including the papers of historic shots along with the 'selfie' version, and the photo/painting of the gentleman in the first 5 minutes. Really adds another layer to the production!!!",
        "I love those selfies starting around 9:15",
        "The pictures taken by the Tsar's daughter are so fascinating. I've never seen anyone from that time depicted in such a human way that's similar to how we take pictures of ourselves now, as opposed to a photo of them sat down blank faced where they seem so far from human that they could be robots. It genuinely makes it so much more real when Michael then goes on to mention how her and the rest of the family were killed by Bolsheviks shortly after.",
        "16:58 Hi Vsauce, Prisoner here..",
        "12:50 I propose we call this, the \"Elsie\".",
        "So happy he\u2019s making videos on this channel again",
        "Seeing that another Vsauce video came out today really boosted my mood. I've been watching Vsauce since about early 2012 when I was almost 14. I'm now 24 years old. It's amazing to think I've been watching this channel for a little over 10 years now!",
        "Did the title of this video change as i was watching it.",
        "Did he call a selfie with more than one person an \"ussie\"? Is that a thing?",
        "\"... are humans a selfie since God created us in his own image?\"\n\nThis is why I watch Vsauce.",
        "Does anybody know who is the woman at 5:36 ? Or where does that picture come from ? She looks identical to my mom, I would love to find out more it\u2019s so funny, like she traveled in time haha !",
        "The icon in the title... I had to paste it and blow it up to like font size 40 to see what it was.",
        "When the world needed him the most, he came back.",
        "I always feel like there's a deeper meaning to all of Vsauce's videos",
        "Did you know, the term \"Selfie\" came from Australia",
        "7:56 It blows my mind how she wrote \"\u042f!\" over her nose on the photo, which means \"me!\" in Russian. And used a  instead of a dot in the exclamation mark. It's like a typical selfie on Instagram, but 100 years ago.",
        "There's a real beauty in self photography from the past; the emotions and context are super candid because the subject is usually alone",
        "Michael sinking into the Vsauce and the putting of his brain food into my grey matter mouth was the most possibly unhinged way he could've ended this video. Thanks Michael!",
        "I\u2019ve missed you Michael!",
        "I enjoyed Michael's 25 minute long selfie of himself.",
        "A blessing! It's completely mind-blowing to me that Michael is still making videos like these. It feels like a dream, I don't know why, maybe it's because of the way I discovered Vsauce, but it's fascinating to say the least. In any way, I am thankful for Michael's existence.",

        "4",
        "I never expected to learn about the Bekussy today",
        "Yesssssss more content",
        "This video feels like a Vsauce classic... a bunch of information not some complex concept that's impossible to understand. The music helps to make it feel like the old videos. It jumps back to your face and I expect to see 2013 Michael. Strange.",
        "This is legendary, thank you Michael, so glad the world has you",
        "Forget the channel name.......search 'bald guy science'....here i am......",
        "This was great. I love all the Grand Dutchess Anastacia Romanov selfies. I saw them years ago, and she is why I am learning the Russian language. I also look a lot like her. She\u2019s one of my favorite people from the past. ",
        "Mitosis was probably the first selfie.",
        "He returns...",
        "I really like how close this feels to old VSauce!",

        "My favourite guy on utube, pls keep creating amazing mind bending content",
        "De elves make elfies?",
        "vsauce  where days no uploads on days it months",

        "at 19:06 I was anticipating POGGERS",
        "omfg i love you vsauce so much",
        "Vsauce is basically random thoughts or questions that pop up in your mind but backed by research",
        "Michael admitting to crimes and hearing \"ussy\" within the first 2 minutes is just splendid. Pure gold.",
        "Knowing that I live in the home country of the word \"Doggo\" makes me very happy",
        "i can't help but feel so nostalgic while watching this",
        "This made me oddly emotional",
        "6:12 that's... heart breaking and I don't know why I didn't think of that\n\npeople can forget your name but can find what you've left behind",
        "Man, I miss the good ol day when we always had new vsauce to watch and new stuff to learn.",
        "I'm not that much of a good looking person, therefore, selfies it is something that I tend to avoid, or I'll make them for my own use and then I'll delete them. So much so that I dig up my old posts with selfies on the social media and purge them out of existence as something to be ashamed of. It is easy to be a selfie model when you in fact a good looking object for that. Otherwise, not so much. Just sayin'. Peace!",
        "Someone keeps changing the thumbnail. Not happy with the views on this one? 1.6M in 6 days not enough? smh youtubers.",
        "Cant wait for Bussy become world of the year",
        "When he said thanks Obama I laughed for real .. and still am",
        "waw, how could you sewed in the polar bear comparison i have no idea ",
        "Had to be an Aussie who invented \"selfie\"",
        "Never end to amaze me how Michael can go from \"who took the first selfie\" to \"this girl and her family was brutally murdered in their basement\" in just a few minutes in the same video.",
        "How do you find the first recorded uses of specific terms?",
        "Michael is like that one uncle who always tell you about the best stories he can find. Not too often but quality over quantity.",
        "I'm just glad he didn't pull a donut out of the toilet this time.",
        "Good to see the old OG Michael back, love the videos ",
        "I never really thought about the social implications of something such as this, it's actually really existential to think about the human condition through self-portraits. I wonder if anthropology has much to say on this academically?... something to look into.",
        "This video was uploaded 4 days ago, and its indistinguishable from the ones uploaded 9 years ago.",
        "1:13 Ussy? O///O",
        "Ussy",
        "The term was coined partially as an abbreviation of Self Portrait but it had a tinge of judgment.+\nIE Girls are obsessed with their looks and the ones who love themselves the most take the most pictures of themselves because they're conceded .",
        "Can we have regular VSauce videos now, please? Millions been waiting for years!",
        "If Michael was a history teacher, none of his students would ever fail!",
        "Vsauce releasing a video will always stand out as a highlight of my life, thank you for such awesome videos!",
        "I am totally loving these new old style Vsauce videos. If time's arrow, Michael is one of my favorite trajectories.",
        "The best youtuber out there fr",
        "9:46 This pic goes so hard",
        "9:26 that really looks like doctor traveled to the past to take a selfie. Weird.",
        "You've got a knack for taking seemingly mundane subjects and turning it into something I could listen to for hours.",
        "Love the content, Michael.",
        "Should we start calling D-pics Delfies?",
        "Only Ogs remember the old title.",
        "The real selfies were the selfies we selfied along the way",
        "Joseph Byron?\nHmm....",
        "Great video. you've remind me of what someone once said\ufe0f  Making money is an Action, keeping money is behavior, Growing money is Knowledge. I once attended seminar and ever since then i been waxing strong financially, and i most tell you the truth.",
        "Bean\u2019s, rice, jesus christ, and BYRON",
        "You aged very well",
        "\"People like looking at themselves.\"\n\nNever have I felt less human and more alien than when this was repeatedly said by Michael.",
        "Excellent research and presentation as always my dude",
        "I audibly gasped when I saw this video was posted. This is the content I am addicted to.",

        "Absolutely LOVED this video. Social history across 3.5 thousand years. Thank you Michael.",
        "What about...A Cornfie?? ",
        "This video really takes me back to the old Vsauce videos! Great video as always.",
        "Loved the video as always. By the way, i would really enjoy if you make a video talking about the  Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon (frequency illusion), which is pretty interesting. Love your work, Michael",
        "Weirdly related to the anacronym. Kids now make the hand signal for phone differently than us.  they hold a flat hand to their ear(like the modern phone)",
        "joseph biren",
        "I haven't watched your content in a long time as soon as that @0.47 music hit came in, it was like a warm blanket, carefully heated from the radiator near my bed.\n\nNever change Michael.",
        "never say Usy again please",

        "Hey, Vsauce! Micheal here. Your home security is great\u2026\n\n\nOr is it?",
        "He only made this 25 minute video to tell you about the stupid belfie thing then hot you with the bad felfie joke. The hustle, the determination, the balls of this great man.",
        "PW\n\n5 hours ago\n\nMichael, I think I can speak for everyone when I say that we're thankful that you're still doing this kind of content. It's captivating as always.",
        "This was absolutely fascinating! It's got me thinking about selfies and self-portraiture in entirely different ways.",
        "I must be the only person on earth that doesn't like or take pictures of myself",

        "a week ago a made a comment about how the the thumbnail wasnt vsauce enough but because of this title change the thumbnail no longer matters",
        "Old classic Vsause....love it",
        "It\u2019s crazy to think that I was watching Vsauce when I first started watching YouTube as an 11 year old. I\u2019m 21 in 8 days",

        "\"If a selfie of your butt is called a belfie then shouldn't a selfie of your face be a felfie?\"\n\nThis has bothered me as a guy who is a nurse. People say I'm a 'murse' as a portmanteau of 'male nurse.' But if I'm a murse then all of my female colleagues should be called 'furses'",
        "Brilliant as ever",
        "I love how this whole video is an ode to humanity. We really never change. All of us want to be remembered. All of us have some amount of fascination at our own image. All of us want to communicate across space and, as it turns out, time. Personally, I find this moving. From handprints on cave walls, to teens sending silly pictures to one another, the only real differences are in the ease, ubiquity, and product quality of the ways by which we record our lives and selves.",
        "Michael, I think I can speak for everyone when I say that we're thankful that you're still doing this kind of content. It's captivating as always.",
        "Everyone knows it's Mr. Bean",
        "This video in particular really penetrated my soul. It's beautiful to see pictures that make people of the past seem so real and human. It seems that grainy, black and white daguerreotypes automatically lead us to view the subjects as stoic, distant, and different from us. Colorized photographs and teenagers taking casual mirror selfies in 1915, smiling and posing like real kids that lived and laughed, just changes things.",
        "am i crazy or he changed the thumbnail then changed it back?",
        "Who watches this whenever Michael changes title?",
        "I really love how waiting for some weeks for content doesnt apply to vsauce.",

Like do we actually read \"S-T-OP\" on a Stop Sign? Or do we recognize it the same as the counting of those dots...",
        "Also admitting to it because the statute of limitations has expired ",
        "I was the one to take the first modern selfie, in 1999 in Florence. I did not know how that would be called a few years later. I could not see what I was framing, but the result was near to perfect, with a nice background too. When I asked my friends \"who do you think took this photo?\", they ALL said \"your wife\". Nobody wanted to believe that it was myself.",
        "Czar Nicolas was a big photography fan as well.",
        "At 7:32 my first thought was \"There is no way he is 14, he looks much older\"\nThen I realised Vsauce just recently made a whole video explaining this exact phenomenon.",

        "As always, worth the wait! Thank you!",
        "I absolutely love that after all this time you are still uploading and educating. I started watching this channel when I was 13 about 10 years ago now. I can\u2019t wait to see more videos in the future. I will never stop watching ",

        "Some say that the Shroud of Turin ( or should I say The Sacred Selfie of Turin ) is the first third-wave selfie ( or, at least the holiest selfie )!",
        "crazy thought that the human organism simply observed images until deciding to be one. I wonder if the becoming of a sign is what produced the subjective self i.e territorialized reality.",

        "The Anastasia story is so sad. She brought a form of happiness that didn't exist before. People had such a hard time appreciating themselves. A hard time looking in the mirror. They still do. But to be able to express your emotion because you are the subject and director in your story. It's just so special.",
        "A selfie of a person\u2019s own self should be called a \u201csselfie\u201d",
        "Good to see you back, Michael. Surprised you didn't bring up that \"Noah took a picture every day for 6 years\" video that got really popular 15 years ago. It nicely encapsulates the idea of Visual Self Documentary.",

        "How Michael is able to take a silly, seemingly random topic such as \"Who took the first selfie?\" and turn it into a 25 minute, excellent, thought-provoking social commentary is so wonderfully inspiring. I've always loved how VSauce videos take so many tangents that are all related to each other yet make a very entertaining and informative video. Michael, you're a genius.",
        "What the point of changing thumbnails over and over again I always wandered",
        "It\u2019s crazy to think I grew up watching vsauce, and now I\u2019m graduating today! thank you Michael for always keeping me entertained! good timing for a new video haha :)",
        "Gotta say, used to be a selfie hater. Still don't take any myself. That said, you have successfully brought me around on their use and advantages.

I remember how I always had just memorized that pi is 3.14 etc but I never conceptualized what it really meant, I just sort of knew it as something used in geometry involving circles and got by with just plugging in the number in equations but then I started watching match videos on youtube and getting more interested in math stuff and then feeling such a joy in understanding how pi is the ratio of the diameter to the circumference, like I had heard that phrased that way before but never really conceptualized what it meant, that a circle with a diameter of 1 will have a circumference of pi, that if you take that circle and lay it out flat the line you would get would be 3.14 units of that 1 unit diameter circle, and when I finally really grasped that for the first time I was just amazed and wanted to share it with everyone else cause it felt so astounding of a revelation to me at the time. And looking at selfies in this whole different way has also brought me to that feeling of revelation, granted maybe not as much but still. It's always just so amazing to see something so simple taken to such detail and to come out of it able to see it in a new light.",
