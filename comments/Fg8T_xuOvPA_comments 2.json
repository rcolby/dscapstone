        "Incredible, un-believable game, almost miracle game and Vikings QB is stand still throwing QB and let the receivers do job and they have the man Jefferson much like Ram's number 10. NFL is team-game but Viking\u2019s QB K. Cousins and Jefferson is Offensive player of the year and Vikings Defense allowed Vikings QB  and receiver Jefferson to finish off, with final interception, my my what a job. I rarely comment on any NFL game, but this is a very special game and yes indeed I fully agree it is game of the year indeed! Bill's QB is not Superbowl quality QB and every time clutch time he blows more ways than one. Any wonder why he was NEVER recruited by SEC Conference, but clearly second-class WAC or now Mountain West Conference. JUST look at Tua, SEC, Eagles QB, SEC, Bangle's QB, SEC, not matured yet but still good enough Patriots QB, SEC, Jagua, not mature enough, but SEC. and ****LOOKING forward to watch Cleveland Brown QB Dushane Watson, *we know Huston Texas women's false allegations to KEEP Watson in Huston and I really think that *penalty is TOOO harsh should have been at the least *HALF game season like 8-game total, considering vast majority women **confessed they were suing Watson to keep him in Huston, but Watson to overcome *politics, he had confess something he did not do and paid lots of money he did NOT have to indeed; yet, women in western society is TOOOO dam spoiled and finger point anyone to get famous, ruin man's life, reputation, back breaking money extraction with question, some clearly bogus like Watson's case according to Watson's lawyers! Overall, smart Watson, compelled to admit something he did not do what the accusers alleged, pay JUST SO HE CAN PLAY FOOTBALL AND MONEY he can recover easily. IN closing, having watched his SEC Championship Game, yes indeed Watson has potential to be Super Bowl QB quality if he gets quality receivers like Dolphin\u2019s QB and his, Tua, top receiver Waddle and Vikings Jefferson are so far I know in addition to Buc's two receivers, *without Gronk and AB, Buccaneer are doomed to win SB this year, also you guess right, Watson came from SEC, Clemson! Any compelling *refutation in regard to my underpinning points? Case closed indeed!",
        "This was the Vikings superbowl lol",
        "Pazzesco",
        "It's funny to see Allan towering of Singletary.",
        "What a game that's a preview of this years super bowl",
        "end of the day - bills blew it.\n\nbeat themselves with their own mistakes. this game is more about bills losing it than vikings winning it",
        "Man are these bills cursed !? Play so damn good then lose these stupid close games. Unfortunate they lost this at home. Allen is good as he is as a gun slinger may want to sometimes go for the short yard throws and maybe take a slide or 2 when running.",
        "Refs cheated in every way possible. No PI call on the jersey being held in the end zone, not calling offside on the QB sneak, not calling for a replay on the no catch and not calling the 12 men on the field. Vikes beat both the Bills and the Refs",
        "Just imagine if we could get a SuperBowl game this exciting ",
        "Reading so many comments.  No hate at all for Josh Allen.  What I saw in this game is pretty much all of his completions are to wide open guys.  Any sort of tight window he misses badly.  The fact Diggs had to leap 11 feet in the air to make catch shows how much a very average QB is bailed our by his pass catchers.  Meanwhile GOD FORBID Lamar has even 1 incompletion them he the worst QB, most over rated QB ever.  Lamar hasn't had anyone even remotely close to throw to as good as Diggs. Lamars WRs are NEVER this wide open.",
        "Reminds me Of Ali Frazier.Amazing game!!!",
        "Amazing game! I wonder if the Bills would\u2019ve took the field goal on that 4th & 2 instead of going for it, I wonder if they would\u2019ve won the game",
        "allen and billz are the epitome of being overrated",
        "They're so relatable, it's quite funny too",
        "Most amazing & exciting game I have EVER seen in my life!  Bills: finesse, execution & speed.  Vikings: all guts and determination. The fact that the Vikings seemed the underdog throughout... makes them them my \"never-say-die\" champs so far this year... and I'm a Patriot's fan. You go Minnesota! You go!",

        "What a beautiful game that was! The referees let them play and it was a game of the century!!",
        "rare example of referee wrong calls making a game more exciting without ruining the end result.",
        "Such an awesome game!",
        "Wow. That was a hell of a game.",
        "your content never seems to disappoint me,keep it up! >:-O",
        "that JJ catch is up there with the all time great ones, who cares if it wasnt a TD. that will be replayed forever.",
        "I don't think the bears played the best game but it would have been going into overtime possibly if Santos didn't miss that field goal he had 40 straight coming into the game well a couple less than that but 40 straight and then he missed one but they're a fairly new put together team hopefully next years even better",
        "Justin Jefferson is the best WR I have ever seen in my life. I've never seen that time of clutch performance before ever. He deserved to have won",
        "What a great game from both teams. I can clearly see growth in The Vikings since they made a lot of off season changes. They\u2019ve developed a fight in them I haven\u2019t seen before, go Vikings.",

        "Game of the year for sure. Can't see how anything will top this. That was wild.",

        "An insane and memorable game, but man the officiating in this game was AWFUL. 2 HUGE things refs missed that allowed the Bills to get the game to overtime. They were in Buffalos pockets 100%",
        "Every year I cheer for the underdog. By memory my list is Detroit Lions Buffalo Bills, Texas, Tennessee, Falcons, Bengals, Cardinals, Vikings, Browns, Chargers and yes the Browns franchise did win 2 Superbowls, after they moved to Baltimore. I even root for the Jets, because it's been so long.",
        "WOW!! What a hard fought back and forth game with exceptional plays by amazing talent! Congratulations  to our Division rivals the Vikings \nFrom a Green  Bay  Packers  fan",
        "Shoutout to that boy from New Orleans #JJ",
        "An exceptional game and the Vikings have shown unbelievable resilience through this season. Give JJ a blank check- Minnesota drafts GOAT wide receivers and this whole team is special. Bills, we\u2019ll see you in the Superbowl.",
        "I think it\u2019s funny how right now a lot of people are talking smack about Justin Hebert having bad games and throwing interceptions when he doesn\u2019t have any of his starting receivers or O-line. But with Josh Allen everyone is trying hard to not talk about his interceptions and blown games even with his entire team being healthy.",
        "What a game! Diggs\u2019 catch: CRAZY\nJefferson\u2019s catch: CRAZIER\n\nVikings deserved the win though since Davis didn\u2019t actually catch the ball therefore there shouldn\u2019t have even been an OT",
        "Dang. Who is this Jefferson character? This game was killing me inside. Epic",
        "Diggs: Unbelievable one handed catch\nJettas: Hold my beer",

        "That no call on 1st & Goal in OT for 12 men on the field is crazy.",
        "This was a super bowl caliber game.. every player was on his game in game",
        "This has got to be the best game of the season thus far! Both Justin Jefferson and Stefon Diggs showed some extraordinary talents. Vikings defense also showed true heart in not giving up on the game. Go Vikings!!!",
        "As a Vikings fan I had so many heart attacks this game insane comeback skol",
        "Worked 12 hours on Sunday. Didn\u2019t get to watch any football. My buddy was like \u201cyou gotta watch this game back.\u201d Did not disappoint. Wow, game of the year 100%.",
        "As a Vikings fan, I want a superbowl win so badly!! But if we don't make it, I hope the Bills do! Just an UNBELIEVABLE game!!",
        "Hold us down but don't count us out",
        "SKOL!",
        "what a game",
        "Sorry Odell but Jefferson catch was greatest catch",
        "This has to be the game of the year.",
        "Red zones becoming nightmare for Allen. I love that guy. but god sake, reduce turnovers and start smart plays.",
        "Buffalo you throw the ball and after that you throw the ball more and more you have no running game because you don't commit to it",
        "Why is no one talking about this amazing sports commentator?!? He made the game 1000 times more exciting!! What\u2019s his name?",
        "WHAT A GAME!!! I LIKE BOTH TEAMS BUT STILL GO VIKINGSSSSS!! SKOL",
        "Sheeesh...THAT was a game.",
        "Waiting for the announcers to start screaming like death metal when they broadcast.",
        "I'm not even a vikings fan,  but I actually found myself rooting for them.  \"The catch.\" That catch was easily the best catch I've EVER SEEN!! as long as I've been watching the NFL (50 years).",
        "18:33 Buffalo has 12 men on the field",
        "Right when you think the Bills and Chiefs games are the game of the year, Minnesota challenged that. One thing for sure, Buffalo plays exciting games win or lose",
        "You know it\u2019s an insane game when cook runs a 81 yd touchdown and no ones talking about it!",
        "I've been watching the NFL since the mid 1960's and that was the most amazing game I've ever seen. How in the heck did Jefferson keep the ball in his hand and off the ground on that 4th & 18?",
        "Why no one talking about the 3rd and 10 that Jeffson caught in OT. lol put them in field goal range",
        "I bet the atmosphere in the stadium was electric, what a game!!",
        "L ratio ronaldo better",
        "its hilarious how kirk cousins kirk cousins is",
        "Respect both teams can't wait to see them in the playoffs",
        "This game had it all.  Superstars everywhere, stars making big plays, stars making mistakes, missed calls by the officials, 4th down conversions, crucial missed PAT, goal line stands, QBs putting their bodies on the line, a catch for the ages, a fumble for the ages, and 2 franchises who have been snake bitten throughout their history battling for respect.  As a Vikings fan since the mid-80s, I expected we'd lose but would have been happy for Buffalo if they won.  Buffalo has earned my respect.  I am now rooting for Buffalo the rest of the way, unless we have a rematch in February :)",
        "most exciting and best game since pats/falcons",
        "What a wild game",
        "Wow  Jefferson is the beast",
        "It's insane that they didn't review the Gabe Davis play. I'm glad the Vikings won, that would have been horrible otherwise.",
        "This game was so crazy! The moment Cousins got sacked for 4th n 18, i thought game over. When i saw the catch, i screamed so loud i dont think i heard myself. GG's Bills fans, heck of a game.",
        "The Bills had it all the needed to do was get out of the end zone.  Things like this end a coaching career and send someone like Sean McDermott to their natural acclimated station.  I picture Sean on really wanting the William and Mary job.  He\u2019s checked out, cashed out, and tube sour to his own messages.  Great teams over coke adversity I don\u2019t see McDermott as anything more or less then a nepotistic hire.",
        "diggs laughing thinking his team won at the end is pure gold",
        "Everyone had a highlight that game!",
        "Justin Jefferson is the real baller.",
        "I don't understand. About that field goal in overtime? Why Vikings didn't win at that moment?",
        "Overcame a 17 pt deficit, a non review on a clear incomplete pass, and 12 man on the field no call on the goal line. Skol",
        "Someone please explain this to me.\n\n(15:10) When it was 4&Goal for the Vikings at the 1 yard line.",
        "Very glad I have Jefferson on my fantasy ",

        "This game was absolutely exhilarating!!!! ",
        "Bills fans: Holy $hit check out that one handed catch by Diggs! Vikings fans: HAHAHA Riiiiiight! How about we do you one three better and have Jefferson go higher, with coverage all over him, and the game on the line?",
        "One of the greatest game in history",
        "Nope there will be better",
        "Definitely the game of the year.",

        "Minnesota Vikings",
        "Possible Super Bowl preview?",
        "Another cardiac win for the Vikings !!! Unbelievable and definitely the game of the year !!! Both teams played amazing football - first the amazing one-hand catch by Diggs for the Bills and then that insane one -hander by Jefferson when he had so much pressure and harassment on him - CRAZY!!! For the most part Allen played some good football considering he was questionable before the game , but he's got to stop throwing those interceptions and that fumble at the end of the game was totally shocking whoever you're cheering for - the Bills actually had the game won , and had some damn good defense to keep the Vikings from moving up the field for most of the game. I'm a fan of both teams and thought that the Vikings were a bit fortunate , but they still have a damn good team and could win the Super Bowl !!! Cook and Jefferson are doing a lot to carry this team - I'm totally thrilled to have seen this game in person - first NFL game !!! Lots of beer , dogs , and pretzel twists , and a steak dinner after the game - oh yeah baby !!!",
        "While watching the last quarter of that game I found about three new emotions that i didn't even know i had. As a life-long Vikings fan... that's sayin' something. Just.... WOW!\n#SKOL LFG!",

        "Bro this game was insane , the bills were most definitely supposed to win this game they gave it away \ufe0f, Josh Allen has not looked like himself these past two or so weeks ik they won today but u can tell that injury is bothering him especially since he's throw 2 Interceptions in back to back game",
        "Those last two overtime connections between cousins/jefferson were elite\u2019r",

        "As a Bears fan, it\u2019s hurts me to see the Vikings win, but anything to keep anyone but GB out of first place. If they end up winning the chip this year, I won\u2019t be surprised. Justin Jefferson is just on another level.",

        "Yeah this felt like a playoff game for sure, #Billsmafia are cursed from the Jim Kelly/Thurman Thomas 90s. They are going to shoot themselves like this game, how n so rare you stopped them yet you fumble TD during hike sessions. Josh Allen got them there yet gave it away with the fumble n Peterson INTs. Can't believe these Viks lost once, Rodgers division is over.",

Superstars everywhere, stars making big plays, stars making mistakes, missed calls by the officials, 4th down conversions, crucial missed PAT, goal line stands, QBs putting their bodies on the line, a catch for the ages, a fumble for the ages, and 2 franchises who have been snake bitten throughout their history battling for respect.  As a Vikings fan since the mid-80s, I expected we'd lose but would have been happy for Buffalo if they won.  Buffalo has earned my respect.  I am now rooting for Buffalo the rest of the way, unless we have a rematch in February :) yes!",

That I don't want to ever hear another Mahomes V Allen comparison. Dude has had 4 years of a terrible division, great HB production, has a top3 WR, a great 2nd WR, really good TE and a smothering defense and still can't get it done. It's just embarrassing to even remotely try to compare the 2. Even worse ppl try to put Herbert in there like half his offense isn't predicated on Ekeler. Stop making excuses it's Mahomes and about 2 tiers down is every other QB. It's been that way for a while now.",

The game of the year is a game in which both teams, the coach and quarterback play their best, set new  records and do not hand the game to the opponent like Josh Allen did in his own end zone or other misplays, fumbles, interceptions and other  missteps  by the Buffalo offense and defense. It may be the game of the year for the Vikings team, who had not received the respect it deserved for its record. Was it a fun game to watch if you are a neutral fan? Yes. Game of the year? No.",

Complete ups and downs filled with nonstop heart attacks... surprisingly we came out on top though which isn't usually the norm lol\nI love this team, I've had so many thoughts after so many different years like damn maybe I should just root for another team...

        "You know it was a good game when the highlights are 20 minutes long. Damn I have been excited for this game!",
        "Bills being the Bills... Stupid coaching decision not to take the 3 points. They would have won...",
        "Pretty sure I saw O'Connell sitting down with Kirk after a horrible interception. I just thought to myself, Zimmer would never do that. I love seeing this positive environment that's being created by the coaching staff.",

        "Hi all I just wanted to share something very important. If you don't have a relationship with Jesus Christ as your Lord, here is your sign to turn to Him!   This is the most important thing you'll ever hear in your life. Jesus is coming back soon! God sent His only Begotten Son into the world, that whosoever shall believe on Him shall not perish but have eternal life. Those who do not believe will be condemned. (John 3:16-18). Jesus died for our sins, and to set us free from our sins and condemnation (John 8:36, Acts 13:39). Jesus rose from the the grave 3 days later after His death, defeating death. He now lives forevermore, and seeing we have saving faith in Him,  we too will live eternally with Him! Jesus is the only way to Heaven (John 14:6). Following Him is the best decision to make in life. Though the Christian life isn't a life absent of difficulty, despite any circumstance Jesus gives true peace and fulfillment, a peace and fulfillment this world cannot give (John 14, John 16).",

        "Justin Jefferson MVP.  Holy cow.  I cannot believe we won this game.  I am so happy to see Kirk Cousins throwing some incredible darts, Dalvin Cook break out like Adrian Peterson used to do and Justin Jefferson is like Randy Moss 2.0.  Our new tight end Hockinson may have been that last key piece we needed.  I really hope to see Vikings make it to the Superbowl once in my lifetime.  So many tragic losses in NFC Championship games and bad playoff runs.  Now that Packers, Lions and Bears are wayy out of the race and we beat all 3 of them.. This is Vikings year.. Eagles no longer undefeated so we are right up there with them although they are the only team to blow us out all year in game 2.  SKOL Vikings! ",
