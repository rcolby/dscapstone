And he looks quite a bit older than the last time I saw him  To be fair, it HAS been probably 3-5 years because it was an old episode, and I havent seen him on this channel in ages either because I mostly watch other channels. A beard can really have a big effect on how mature you look, the last time I saw him he was clean shaven and baby faced ",
        "We know about more than 100 elements at this point, and they are listed in a Periodic Table for a reason -- because their properties are periodic in nature. It is extremely likely that any new elements we find will have properties that are merely variations on well-established themes.",

It's interesting that scientists now believe that there are stability islands very far up the periodic table, so my disdain for any scifi show that includes 'new elements' is mostly just hubris, as advanced societies may actually be able to produce new elements with amazing properties.",

It might be that one ancestor gave us our chromosomal DNA, while another gave us our mitochondrial DNA. These two contributions could have come from two distinct emergences of life. So we didn't eat our competition, we recruited it.",
        "The stable isotopes of super heavy elements may unlock many possibilities, e.g., interstellar travel, that current human beings can only dream of. But I suspect this might be the fate of humanity after all. We are not in a galaxy that\u2019s near to the remnants of large enough stars that would provide these valuable resources for free. This could also be the real answer to the Fermi Paradox. The real treasure in the universe are some stable isotopes of super heavy elements, but we don\u2019t have it here or somewhere near here.",

Your search into the weeds of how certain elements used to exist, but decayed before we got here.  It doesn't explain anything if it explains everything. I ran into that in OC where they were confident they'd figure out how Life makes all these organic compounds and how they discovered how to make insulin without needing herds of animals. Soon synthetic insulin would be cheap. Well we still do not know how to create insulin, we just used recombinant DNA and put the insulin genes into bacteria or yeast and the living organism makes the insulin, but it is cheap and only cost $10 to make a month's supply they charge $300 for.

        "Originally we were supposed to get an island of stability around element 114, but they just keep getting more unstable as we make heavier elements.  The heavier elements seem to be caught in a squeeze in which those that do not have a high enough neutron to proton ratio alpha decay very rapidly, whereas those that have a higher neutron to proton ratio spontaneously fission (you see this first with fermium, of which isotope 257 is the most stable isotope, alpha decaying with a half-life of 100.5 days, and then isotope 258 spontaneously fissions in less than a millisecond (and note that the even-even rule of stability doesn't work here and for some other transuranium elements), and isotopes 259 and 260 also spontaneously fission very quickly.  After fermium, you get a slight break with mendelevium, for which you can get the highest few isotopes to have enough neutrons that they can actually beta decay, but then starting with nobelium anything that doesn't alpha decay spontaneously fissions, and it gets faster until by the time you get to the upper end of what we have been able to make, you can't do anything with what you have made other than confirm detection.",

If I remember correctly Venus has a very dense nitrogen atmosphere. How much energy would it take to convert enough of the nitrogen to carbon 14  and could it then somehow be bombarded with protons and further convert some of that to oxygen stabilizing the resulting element? I suppose you would need a butt ton of energy and would have to localize the initial conversion so you could focus on the carbon 14 before it would dilute into the remaining nitrogen assuming the carbon 14 did not coalesce into large clumps.

        "Understanding element 43's instability is signifiant to understanding atomic properties.  It is very likely that atomic mass including neutrons plays a significant role in the stability and half life of an element.  It is likely an instability that the ratio of the mass of an element versus the force that holds atoms together will have either electrons or protons decay to a stable slow moving element.  It is very likely that manipulating electromagnetic forces or creating a stronger electromagnetic field or diamagnetic field will alter the speed of decay or create a new way to stabilize elements.  It is like how the moon right now is in orbit around the Earth.  Slowly that orbit is decaying to the point that it will no longer orbit the sun or shift its orbit away.  You could say that the decay is there.  But what if we introduced gravity to warp the gravity around the moon?  Well, we would be able to manipulate the orbit and decay of said moon.  Thus, we could create a stable isotope that is easy to use for nuclear fusion or non-radioactive elements.  Proving to use electromagnetism and diamagnetism would need to be key for this to work.  But nucleear fusion would be more possible and we would be able to decay say Lithium into a stable form of helium or what not.  Instead of mining the moon like the aliens are doing............",
