Even if I'll have an impact on an significantly little crowd compared to you Take, I'll make sure it's great and worthwhile, just to put some respect on your existence in all our lives. I pray to God to please rest your soul in eternal peace and in paradise cause I feel that's the least that you'd deserve for all the good memories and smiles you gave all of us.
