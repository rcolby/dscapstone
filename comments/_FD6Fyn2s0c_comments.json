        "Is there a series where they take the best that have appeared on the channel, place them in a bracket style tournament and see who comes out on top? Or better yet. Let the fans vote on their favorites and then they play out the randomized bracket. Sure some of the matches might be one sided but some of them might end up being matches that would never be explored and be major upsets. Like maybe someone that previously lost can beat superman but Goku gets a good line to the finals. it would be cool to see how the fan favorites really stack up in a randomized Death Battle Royal.",
        "There was really only one outcome. The Lich King is super strong but has canonically been defeated in combat by adventurers, meanwhile Sauron hasn't really been defeated the same way. So the Lich King has a clear physical limit whereas Sauron is much more ambiguous.",

        "It's amazing they can think of options how will Sauron can survive but for Vergil they didn't just to let Sephiroth win..",
        "Here's the issue though. You are basically comparing an angel/god thing to a man. An empowered man, but a man nonetheless. This was imbalanced from the beginning. Do Sauron vs Sargeras, that's comparable.",
        "There have been a lot of powerhouses throughout this channel, but this fight FELT the most powerful",
        "I like this episode but don't combatants have armies to command, this would be cool to see in a robotnik vs. Wiely style death battle",

        "When this fight was announced I was immediately rooting for Sauron he THE fantasy dark lord",
        "Hmmmm not so sure about this call. I agree that Sauron has more experience and is physically stronger, but I think two points get glossed over here worth noting;\nFirst, Sauron being able to fight as a spirit without a body and change and warp his own soul is a pretty potent flex that needs to be accounted for sure- but Frostmourne explicitly damages and slices souls. I feel like that is a counter to that defense and a hard one at that. Isildur managed to at least debilitate Sauron, separating him from the ring, by slicing off his finger with a broken and less powerful blade.",
        "Sauron felt weirdly like a protagonist in the animation. I'm not saying he seemed heroic, but like... the way he shows up as the aggressor, only to be repeatedly put on the defensive in battle.\nHe spends most of the fight going out of his way to counter Arthas's abilities, instead of being the one Arthas has to counter, except for when he turns into a wolf and later when he unleashes his anime super mode",
        "Quick question, why couldn't the Lich King had just cut the One Ring from off of Sauron's hand? From what the opening to the Peter Jackson films showed us, that was a one hit KO. And that was done from a non magical blade too!",
        "Why did I read this initially as liver king",

        "The battle takes place at the site of the Frozen Throne, between two insanely powerful, soul-claiming Tin Tyrants. Whoever wins, both the world of Azeroth and the world of Middle-Earth lose.",
        "Please do Kratos vs Dante that would be brutal",

He's has had thousands of years to plan out his evil deeds and build himself as the strongest MFer to ever exist, physically and spiritually, therefore he cannot be defeated by sheer power and magic. The only reason he was defeated was because of his own hubris, a lesson taught in Tolkein's work. Poor Arthus/Lich King could only do so much before he would be inevitably overwhelmed.",

        "No matter what happens, how old I get, what happens in my life, who comes in and out of it, these videos will always be here for me, and for all of us. Techno was a light that shone brighter than any other out there, and he was a real beacon of hope for many of us. I'm just very glad that he's resting now, and doesn't have to suffer anymore. Props to you, Techno, and as the saying goes, \"Technoblade nevah dies!\"",

        "Welp, looks like Asta Vs deku is next, deku has some good feats, but Asta blitz and slams",
        "This was an amazing episode, Absolutely love both of these Dark Lords but the next episode is gonna be a blowout. \nBase Asta pre-training arc is faster than light speed, thats without the spade training arc, devil union, or zetten.",

        "The giant silly weapon club is looking STACKED today",
        "As someone who has fought the Litch King AND read LotR I can say this outcome is correct.",
        "Well this was pretty cool. And now it has me wondering which side would come out on top in an army vs army fight. Could the forces of Mordor similarly stomp the Lich King's undead, or would Sauron have to step in personally like he did against the Last Alliance to turn the situation back in his favor?",

        "I honestly don\u2019t know about the next matchup Asta is literally in the middle of learning new powers so this one might have to be a redo, since the power is not at its greatest atm if they include it",
        "@16:15 I thought the Nazgul would show up to fight those Lich King's spirits",
        "Wonder if the Jailer could beat Sauron. The jailer or Zoval in Wow has been around forever and is quite powerful. He made the Lich kings armour...well got help and then he controled it.",

        "I'll be honest... that ended up being the most bad-ass Sauron I've ever seen. Fantastic and it really, really made it clear just how terrifying Sauron was.",
        "Nerdge time. This was amazingly entertaining... But during that fight, all Arthas had to do was instead of aiming for the head, aim for Sauron's hand and disembody the Ring.. it might have been anticlimactic to do that, and sure the fight wouldn't have been \"over\" but it would've been delayed 2000 years while Sauron slowly built back his form. The silly Maiar was significantly weaker in the Third Age after he built the Ring than he was in the First Age before he lost his Werewolf/Vampire transformations, and even the Second Age when he lost his fair form in the Flood of Numenor (Numenor, a human/half-elven nation that had such a mighty navy that Saurons army noped out of fighting, not so supreme a dominating will it would seem).",

        "How do you even win against a being that even death wont accept..",
        "As cool as this was, my Tolkien fan brain is questioning Sauron's actual fighting skills outside of being a sorcerer because he still lost to an Elf and a Human in the last alliance and got his finger cut off... But epic animation though.",
        "Super Android 17 vs Amazo",
        "beautiful matchup!!",
        "Shadow of war Sauron and map",
        "As much as I was rooting for my boy the Lich King, I was hard pressed to think of any way he could have beaten Sauron. There\u2019s just no beating the OG Dark Lord",
        "I always thought that Frostmourne breaking in game was specifically due to being struck by a holy sword of extreme power (Ashbringer), rather than just through sheer force. Still an amazing fight to watch and I doubt it would have changed the result.",
        "What the F#@K just happened?",
        "Badass",
        "Isn't frostmourne capable of sealing souls? Which Sauron would have any way to defend against other than his will? Also the Lich king is not just Arthus, it was is the fusion Arthus and Nerzhul... Also not using his army of the undead vs Sauron's Uruk? Missed opertunity. Pulling in non canon Sauron lore but ignoring/missing Lich King lore is a rookie move guys.",
        "I knew Sauron would win, but I was hoping the Lich King would. There must always be a Lich King!\nWait... Lich King Sauron... shudders",
        "A sad boi with a magic helmet vs a literal god.  Pretty surprising outcome to say the least",
        "Wasn\u00b4t the only thing capable of destroying Frostmourne a literal definition of light, the power Sauron doesnt have, considering hes a Dark Lord? Also, wouldnt Frostmourne at least severly weaken Saurons spirit by trying to absorb it all the time at least? I feel like this one is really compromised on based on the island stuff while it could go either way. I mean in game players whack up Ragnaros who creates stuff like MT. Doom by walking around and Sauron\u00b4s power is near unmesurable, (+ Frostmourne draws power from like, the Maw and literal gods- just like sauron)",
        "This battle wasn\u2019t the most brutal but it was probably the most epic. Seeing Sauron get that win was so satisfying. Put respect on the OG dark lord.",

        "And that folks is the reason why the LotR good guys really, REALLY didn't want him to get his jewelry back.",
        "Um, no. This is incorrect.",
        "NEVER!!! Sauron could never beat the Lich King!!",
        "This has to be a joke. People think this is one of the best Death Battles?\nSauron at the height of his power didn't have a physical body. It was the ring keeping him together. That's why he exploded after Isildur cut the ring from his hand. The Plague of Undeath would have done NOTHING to him, he never had to shapeshift into the Eye.",
        "T-T-THE ONLY REASON SAURON WON WAS CAUSE HE'S A FIRE/DARK TYPE POKEMON AND ARTHAS WAS AN ICE/GHOST TYPE POKEMON!!!",
        "how many times did you watch this ?\n\nYES? NO? YES? NO? maybe..",
        "By far my favorite death battle to date. The last half of the fight was epic.",
        "Why didn\u2019t you have Arthas summon sindragosa or his literally horde of undead? But y\u2019all gave Sauron the ring ok. It was over before it started this battle sucked.",
        "Epic matchup, clunky animation\nThough I am glad to see the true Dark Lord pull ahead",
        "Damn it next up is my two favorite anime's against each other",
        "Damn that was a pretty legit battle scene. One of the best ones so far.",
        "The cool thing to remember when watching this. This is sauron holding back since canonically if he took you serious, he preffered to end his enemies with his bare hands to humiliate you when youre armed, the mace was just for the movies to show how much more powerful he was compared to everyone else. Even morgoth used the hammer grond and was able to note saurons savagery. Also sauron lost his shape shifting after his first fall locking him in one form as a sign he could only destroy no matter how much he wanted to created something beautiful hence why his created language of black speech was harsh for everyone else to here as shown when gandalf spoke it at the council when forming the fellowship.",

        "How is this even a Battle? Lich King wins all day.  \n\nSauron was beat by two gnomes wearing junk loot and like 2 greens,  deleting a rare.    ",
        "It'd be kinda cool to know the Victor between Sebas (Overlord) and Sebastian  (Black Butler). Battle of the butlers ftw",
        "This was the most metal death battle ever. So glad it didn't come down to just whacking each other with their weapons. Few indeed could endure the eye of Sauron the Terrible.",
        "The Lich King is like the Night King on steroids.",
        "You ignored how death magic works in Warcraft, Arthas literally dismantles and carves souls along with spiritual bodies. Arthas can literally cut ghosts in half and kill them. I'm not saying the LK would of won regardless but you ignored like the entire magic tool kit he has. Arthas also beat Illidan who literally fought something that would of erased Sauron from existence.",
        "You should do:\nSpeed o' Sound Sonic\nV.S.\nMinato Namikaze",
        "Just a minor nitpick, but technically Sauron wouldn't have his index finger at this point, assuming you're using a version of him after he got the ring back.",

        "arthas was upscaled for this fight .  Interesting",
        "It would be cool if you guys did a Death Battle with Lei Shen The Thunder King, he's also a character from World of Warcraft and is pretty strong.",

        "Then agin the litch king wasn't really fight at full potential there I mean he controls the undead so we're tf is his minions lmao not to mention he controls a crap ton of raid bosses too and another litch that is super loyal to him",
        "Holy crap Gus reference??? These guys do their homework!",
        "Though I like both of them , I think an easy way to compare them would be the fact that in the world of azeroth there were a lot of strong characters able to wield magic or other unatural powers compared to LOTR eventaully sauron was defeated by mortals wielding nothing impressive but regular weapons and regular powers with a very few exceptions like ( the astari , aragorn , elves etc ) the lich king managed to become the top dominating power against multipule races just like sauron did but the difference here is that Dalaran alone holds probably enough power to kill everyone in middle earth. Also while both of them were terrifying to face 1 on 1 the peak of their power comes from their armies and domination , Sauron had to be crafty and deceitful to defeat the other races since he knew alone he couldn't achieve that and raising an army of orcs does require some time the lich king on the other hand just went on and killed everything that stood in his path and oftenly in much worse way since your troops are dying means his army is increasing",

And the things he could do here he cannot do instantaneously, corrupting and reshaping beings takes time and he would need to apply his own \"soul\" to do it, which is why the ring being destroyed took much of his power away, a large part of his soul was destroyed with it. Warcraft magic has no such limitations requiring to use life essence or your own soul to perform the things done here.",

They were both iconic and famous Dark Lords of the Fantasy genre, but Sauron just outplayed the Litch King. I mean Sauron's power is just more powerful than the powers of The Litch King, and was slightly more durable, plus since Sauron was around longer and had more experience he definitely was a greater threat than the lord of The Scourge. This was definitely a good fight, a battle definitely worthy of being one of the best out there as well as being a great clash between two powerful and iconic fantasy villains. Honestly The Litch King gave a valiant effort and I'll always be a Litch King fan...but he just couldn't outmatch the awesome might, enduring spirit and millennia of treachery of the dark lord...Sauron. Plus, I Sauron is the grandfather of fantasy villains...I really couldn't see this fight going any other way.

Doom and several other locations as a power generator of sorts.  Which is why Sauron made the One Ring at Mt. Doom, so as to suck up as much of that energy as possible.  The thing is Mt.

If you look at the LOTR from an MMO standpoint Sauron had trash mini-bosses and to kill him was basically an escort quest. The campaign through the whole trilogy was so weak, only one main NPC died at that was Boromir. No one else of any consequence even came close to death. Where is this nerd rage coming from? Ever spend a thousand gold respecc'ing from tank to heals to dps and back just to get your guild through the first 11 bosses only to get to the Lich King and WIPE because of a freaking BUG??? Sauron is nothing compared to  shoddy development and what's worse.....I hear Classic is bugged too. SMDH",

        "Great vid. I'm a huge Warcraft fan and was rooting for Arthas. However, I would guess Sauron is the superior dark lord. Arthas is from mortal origin afterall, and considering Shadowlands lore, a wayward pawn of the Jailer. Most of the Lich King's might consists in his army, which i would think is superior to Sauron's. But again, on a 1x1, Sauron with his demi-godly origins should win.",
        "I\u2019ve always wanted to watch the Lord of the Rings, and I saw this video and saw the thumbnail and thought \u201coh those guys look awesome let me watch this video\u201d I guess I just spoiled myself smh",

        "should have be arthas vs lord soth",
        "You made a mistake with the lore that I am obligated to highlight. The heroes did NOT succeed against The Lich King. At the end of the fight, everyone dies. The Lich King kills the 25 heroes and gives a monologue about how Tirion Fordring delivered the greatest fighting force the world had ever seen, and that he was going to raise them as undead to serve him. It literally took a miracle from The Light to shatter Tirion Fordring's bonds so that he could get a lucky strike from behind, and for the ghost of Arthas' father to resurrect everyone to finish the job, all the while the spirits of the people Arthas/Lich King killed held him in place. Basically, it was a cascade of miracles that defeated The Lich King. Even still, I do not belive that this detail would have changed the outcome of the battle.",
        "Can we please have death battle winners battle eachother? There'd be some super cool match ups!",
        "They used The Lich King's Heroes of the Storm model and Sauron's Shadow of War model. Nice. I'd have preferred the Lich King's cinematic model and Sauron's movie model, but this? This allowed smoother animation. And therefore more awesomeness to happen.",
        "sauron's conceptual weight is far too great for anything that is mortal or at least once was",
        "OK, you posted on Twitter about talking about a match up with Kamen Rider Ichigo, but since it was just DB-CAST, that'll probably NEVER get seen here.\nKind of disappointing and totally got my hopes up. Seriously, feature a Kamen Rider in Death Battle. Ichigo, Black-RX, Kuuga, Decade, OHMA FREAKING ZI-O. One of them, please!",
        "If Loki and Satan did a fusion ",
        "Its like watching Narutoad and Sasuki fight, but quietly.",
        "Unfortunately, Sauron did not take into account only one thing that the Lich King had hundreds of millions of dead and without the Lich King the Scourge Army would become uncontrollable and his faithful servants mighty creatures from different worlds And each of them is stronger than the other, and they definitely won\u2019t forgive the death of the ruler, they will come and take revenge!",

        "umm good video but if i am not wrong sauron can rebuild his body at instan it requires  1, 10, 100 years each time he was hurt o defeat",
        "Lots of missed stuff on both sides. I could have seen either winning just for the fact that they each have a \"counter\" to the other. You can't dominate Sauron and Sauron can't dominate LK because of the Jailer. Sauron can have no body and be a spirit yet Frostmourne literally attacks the soul and spirit and consumes it. Sauron is bound to the ring and LK to the sword and helm but mostly the sword. LK also uses tons of undead but you could argue Sauron has the orcs so I guess is equal. Sauron's armor and weapon aren't special to my knowledge. LK has stronk armor and soul rending sword. Sauron uses fear as a huge tool in fighting, but you can't fear a being with no soul. I think LK wins ONLY because he seems like the perfect match to counter Sauron. But Sauron is basically a demi god so I get it.",
        "Great fight, sound effects were great and these guys are awesome villians, but fellow needs remember finer details, they skipped some stuff of time. Sauron, after the sinking of a 3.9 quadrillion island, was unable to keep his shape changing even with the one ring. Thanks to God after that plan was washed away, he was reduced to his physical body. PERMANENTLY no shape changing, just old fashioned...everything else. Still crazy powerful though.",

A former Archangel of Wisdom, he became disillusioned to the eternal struggles of good vs evil, and ultimately saw fit to become the Angel of Death in an attempt to eliminate humanity from the equation (in DIablo, humans are effectively the grand-descendants of the union between rogue angels and demons that didn't agree with the war, so humans hold within them both good and evil, and are allowed to choose for themselves, which leaves the balance of power eternally unstable, though more often than not tipping in favor of evil, at least in Malthael's eyes). Malthael's origins seem to make him a good match for Sauron, while his abilities and nature as a video game antagonist likely make him scale better to the Lich King. Either way, it'd have made for one hell of a three way.",
