        "Very disappointed with the Match Officials for their obvious cultural biassed decision making against the Samoans. A inocuous vertical lift which resulted in a 10 minute rest for Junior Paulo followed by an actualy serious injury to the spine of a Samoan player when an English player did a crusher tackle on him, the result was only a penalty against the English player. The offense should have resulted in a more serious sanction including a time in the bin. Then the Junior Paulo late charge on an English player who decided to do a Soccer player theatrics with a wee bump off by Junior when he was already committed to the tackle and was merely attempting to retract from the contact but his large mass of a Prop couldnt stop his momentum from making contact with the kicker, the Referee should have ignored the English players theatrics and milking it for all its worth....The result was an 8pt try bringing the English back into the game.....Samoa were almost robbed of their victory because of the Australian Referee's very biassed Refereeing decisions. An 8pt try nearly cost Samoa the game....the 10 minutes sin bin for the inocuous vertical upending of the English player should only have been a penalty because he was brought down safely. The crusher tackle was by far more serious and could subject the player to a more serious spinal injury in which the English player was only penalised for it...He should have been sent from the field for malicious intent. There is a need to review the quality of Referees officiating games, even the NRL have doush bags and this Bloke is one of the biggest doush bags around. We need more Pacific Islander Referees in the world cup. There is too many cultural biassed officialdom that needs to be stamped out. Such biassed officialdom historically has costed many Pacific Island Nations sorely in game results and it needs to be changed. We need unbiassed and culturally neutral officials.",
