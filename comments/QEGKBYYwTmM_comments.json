        "Floyd would have went harder sparring an aspiring 13 year golden glove fighter.... this fight was \"taking it easy on some one\" to a whole new level",
        "Floyd just played with him like a junior sparring partner in his gym, he pulled pretty much every punch to avoid hurting Deji, the gulf in ability is there for all to see, it\u2019s not a contest on any level - and people paid money to see this ",
        "Floyd was just playing",
        "What a humble guy, at any time deji could've tried",

        "WASTE OF TIME!!!!!!!!",
        "Deji just showed Floyd too much respect. It\u2019s as simple as that. You see it a lot in boxing. He knew what he was in against and showed him to much respect and was to tense and hesitant. But it was always gonna go that way I called it when the fight first got made I knew exactly what was gonna happen. But look it was always going to happen that way, Deji isn\u2019t a boxer and Floyd is the goat.",

        "Deji Gave Floyd Black Eye With One Punch!",
        "People forget this is an exhibition so it's not really a matter of who's gonna win but a learning experience for deji at this point. To step into the ring with one of the greats and basically go toe to toe is a great way to hone his skills and learn more.",

        "Floyd out there doing emotes on Deji ",
        "I guess it was a money fight there\u2019s no other reason for this fight. It just shows that there\u2019s levels to this. Denis coaches let him down letting him take or make this fight it was silly. Performing and putting himself in danger for a check. Plus your gonna have a bunch of clowns talking about how he\u2019s back to losing anyone who thought there was any other possible outcome is living in a cave. It must\u2019ve been a money fight still silly.",

        "STAAAAAAAAAAAAHP - STHAAAAAAAP STHAAAAAAAAAAP",
        "Watching Floyd in this fight is like watching Roy Jones",
        "I\u2019m glad Floyd didn\u2019t do too much - he was obviously not putting any steam on his punches\u2026 I respect that because Deji seems like a nice guy and there\u2019s no need for Floyd to try to hurt him in an exhibition match. Props to Deji for his preparation and growth as a fighter",

        "These fights are cringe",
        "Floyd showed a lot of respect in this he had no beef with deji and really was just showing him and teaching him rather than going crazy. That\u2019s love fr and deji did great held his own even though he was shaking but your going against one of the greatest so understandable. Floyd just trying to give the crowd a show and let deji get some experience watching him move and when he taunts him a little it\u2019s when deji is usually slightly out of range so I hope he noticed Floyd\u2019s standing and the way he\u2019s prepared to move out of the line of punches rather than blocking.",
        "Out of ALL the people who would steal your kids, I never suspect someone like KC to steal them, Im ashamed of her, she should know better",

        "More entertaining than any Jake or Logan Paul fight",
        "Hate that Floyd ain\u2019t hit him with the Philly Shell , he wouldn\u2019t have been able to touch Floyd",

        "Ref kinda stopped it too early",
        "Floyd told his homies bet knock out on the 6 because Deji will be easy pickings tired. Floyd went all out on the 6th and the ref seems to be the same guy that always refs for floyd",
        "Wonder what ksi thinks of this fight",
        "somebody please tell me why this 'fight' even was sanctioned (besides a floyd money grab)....floyds so masterful at his craft this was just a joke",

        "This must of been a tribute to Jerry Lewis.",
        "Im not sure this type of new entertainment suits me. Floyd always been my favorite...but when he was actually boxing. This is more monkey business...we can still see that Floyd is on another level. I wish Dej would of  opened the machine and let go punches.",
        "Floyd is like an untouchable kung fu master, but in real life.",
