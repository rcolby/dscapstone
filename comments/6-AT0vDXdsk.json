I lost my mom several years ago quite unexpectedly, and though time takes you further away from that moment of separation, you will carry those wounds forever. People say it gets easier with time. It does not. You just learn how to press forward, and carry the spirit of your loved ones with you. That's all we can do. As I remind myself daily, No one gets out of here alive; it's all part of the great circle of life. I'm a brain cancer survivor and legally blind so I for one can tell you, you never know what trials and tribulations the next day may hold, so teach yourself to be thankful for what you have had in the past; family, friends and love, and accept what comes tomorrow with open eyes and an open heart. You will be okay. Trust in that. Honor the memories of your dad and what he stood for and lead a righteous life. That's all we can do. .much love and respect to the both of you, and your family.", "I lost my grandpa three weeks ago and my wife lost her mom two weeks ago. Our hearts go out to you both.
