        "\"i don't usually need help catching you freakazoids\" am i tripping or does this imply that cesare is a clown bounty hunter of some kind",

        "WIRE lore?!",
        "real flcl vibes in this one",

        "the wire is makin' a lot more sense now.",
        "Wait, is Steve supposed to be related to the clowns from the Wire video?",
        "Oooh. The lore deepens!",
        "This just keeps getting better and better!",
        "I love the fact that worthikids hid nothing about Steve and Cesare being \"different\" I was kinda hoping that the backpack and lunchbox was empty and the weight was just Steve being a literal clown though",
        "\"I'm the albatross across your clavicle\" is my new villain catchphrase i will scream when people question why i am so annoying and persistant.",
        "Cesare was such a profoundly overwhelming force of a character that I went out of my way to find and understand the wonderful Chris Fleming. I appreciate this show so much, it is so refreshingly good. Thank you all for your hard work and for such an organic story.",
        "When Steve said \"I cant move\" after all of Cesare's monologuing I said \"Yeah.. That's the point\" in perfect sync.... LOL",
        "This series is a masterpiece.",
        "WORTH THE WAIT!! I was having difficulties waking up, not wanting to do chores, but THIS! THIS GAVE ME THE ENERGY!!!",
        "Did we just lose our jobs?",
        "Turns out \"Down\" had loads of foreshadowing about Steve, what is the next opening theme alluding to? In old Venezia, did Cesare make his trade selling marionettes in his ramshackled place? On that hallowed night when Cesare lost his life, is all he remembers the gleam of the knife? He just did vanish with no traces smh",
        "I found this today at 3:00 in the morning and I have enjoyed it in its entirety. The soundtrack was pretty great too. Thanks for making it.",

        "this show is like a burger you have to wait an hour to get at a restaurant, but it\u2019ll taste delicious once you have the burger.",
        "The hammer that Cesare uses to squish Steve looks a lot like the pole thing that the clowns used in Wire. Just a bit of background lore",
        "I absolutely love the part where Steve says he can't move, because it seems so redundant and obvious UNTIL you realize that he's not just trying to move, he's trying to SHAPESHIFT.",
        "These shows are so awesome! I love the music so much! The comedy in this slaps! Please keep making more!",
        "Heavy FLCL vibes",
        "This series slowly became an anime didn\u2019t even notice.",

        "ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh this was  so cooooooooooooooooooooooooooool",
        "A war between the two ruling powers of the universe, clowns and monsters. Will the carnage and tragedy never end? Is this the last we see of Steven the clown? How will the Big Top Burger crew get the truck back on four wheels? The suspense is making me squeak with anxiety and fear and awe. I applaud you for the phenomenal show you have put on, and look ever forward to your future.",
        "M A G I C K E T T L E B E L L S",
        "It\u2019s obvious in hindsight but I like how Penny unwittingly foreshadowed when she talked about how Steve was practically sinking into the earth.",
        "So NO ONE is gonna talk about the JoJo like pose at \"that's a lot of weight\" ??????",
        "He MURDLED HIM DUDE",
        "Woooooo!! What an ending!! I mean Steve is stuck in that Overheated microwave land and Cezare Got the coolest jubies this episode snippet had to offer fantabulous imagery sirs!!",
        "Love love love these!",
        "man this shit was insane",
        "And just like that 6 people had lost their jobs",
        "WHAT?????!!!!!!!",
        "honestly the biggest plot twist the episode was that ceasare wasn't actually invested in the burger business or his crew, they were just a means to an end",
        "Does anyone one know the song at 2:30 ?",
        "everytime i'm always more confused",
        "The slight sneer of disgust when Caesar says \"yeah, that's the point.\" Is such amazing detail.",
        "Amazing",
        "The facial expression and character movement in this are absolutely fucking gorgeous! I love this! ;P",
        "2:32 NEVER REST AND NEVER SLEEP \nA THOUSAND YEARS MY WATCH TO KEEP\nTRICKSTER GODS RISE FROM THE DEEP \nTRICKSTER GODS RISE FROM THE DEEP",
        "Cesare's dialogue, attitude, and existence have transcended comedy and have become iconic",
        "I have no idea what the fuck is happening, but that was amazing",
        "Steve said Merry Christmas in the first episode and now he\u2019s being defeated while Cesare says Feliz Navidad.",
        "For the wondering the line \" I'm the albatross around your clavicle\" is a play on the term \" albatross around you neck\". A phrase meaning an associate/ previous  action that hinders one's abiltys succeed",
        "Where can I read the manga?",
        "pleas let the next season be in the \"Wire\" video style",
        "I love the magic effect when Cesare snaps his hands, reminds me of when they'd have 2d animated special effects in older live action movies.",
        "I didn't expect Cesare to suddenly be a badass but im not complaining\n\nAlso, the fact that Cesare can hold all of the items he gave steve with ease implies that either the kettlebells are only heavy for certain people since they're, y'know, magic, or Cesare has super strength.",
        "Definitely has a FLCL vibe to it.",
        "Damn....he got destroyed",
        "My favourite part of the Big Stetson is the fact Cesare doesn\u2019t sound menacing in the slightest. With both other gifts pretty much everything he said was threatening in a sense, but not with the Big Stetson, he was just as innocently excited at such a nice hat as everyone else.",
        "the music that starts at 2:32, anyone know if that's released song of theirs yet?",
        "I thought that lunchbox was suspiciously cool",
        "Everything you create is golden. I knew Caesar was magical! I really do love all of your stuff.",
        "WHAT MUSIC ???",
        "Wait a minute is this connected to the wire? Is there a clown and underworld war?",
        "Well that took a turn",
        "aaaaAAAAAAAH it's unhealthy how much I love these, I would pause my wedding for a new upload fr",
        "I really appreciate the super underwhelming SHWRP when Cesar\u00e9 just. Leaves via cartoon hole",
        "thought i recognized the name giles corey so i googled it and when i realized who it was started immediately laughing my ass off. god the jokes in this show are so clever",
        "I have no idea what's going on and yet...... I must watch.",
        "So Cesare is a descendant of the vampires from \"Wire\" and is getting revenge on the Clowns, aka Steve, after years of planning. At least that's my view.",
        "Ah yes a new edition to a great series",
        "rewatched the entire series like a week ago i could not be more prepared for this",
        "I love this series so much!",
        "When ya in a discord call at 3:30 am",
        "Steve was involved in the airship raid on the vampire castle, I'm convinced of it",
        "ngl I feel like once the gift is given, it should be up to the giftee as to what to do with it whether that be regifting it or returning it so steve would've absolutely been in the right if he had done that\n(however tim would not have been able to lift the lunchbox to our knowledge as he seems to be a standard human)",
        "WHAT???!",
        "i was randomly suggested this by Al Gorythm and honestly, while I have absolutely no fucking idea whats going on I love it",
        "(could this be an anagram?)\nDown\nPanel\nBackpack",
        "Holy Shit how much of Wire its being used here: the war between clowns and vampires/undeads, the use of expandiple weapons, now i wanna se a full on breach.",
        "This show continues to propose questions without answers and I'm honestly here for it, I love the lore of this series",
        "What is the name of the song while Cesare is smushing Steve?",
        "I want to hear a full version of Down with the redone vocals",
        "The quality looks even sharper than before. Amazing ",
        "I LOVE DIS KEEP UP DA GOOOD WOR",
        "this artstyle is amazing damn",
        "I knew the video Wire had something to do with this universe as well. 20/10 perfect story telling!",
        "Cesare's Upper Management line with him pointing down is such a great moment, it really shows off his personality along with how casual he is even when finally getting Steve after what sounds like quite a bit of time.",
        "THE LOREEEEEE!!!!!!",
        "There is something familiar in Olivia Craighead's voice... dunno why lol",
        "More weight.",
        "Oh the magic kettlebell deleted Steve's beanie cap from existence",

        "hell yeah",
        "I absolutely love this so much!",
        "So glad that we've had two whole episodes now about things being very heavy.  We love you Worthi. <3",
        "Steve: Perplexes, confuses and generally runs circles around his employees but never seems to explicitly reveal himself to be a magic superclown for presumably years \nCesare: Reveals the undeniable existence of magic, blows the mind of every mundane person in the area, causes massive property damage and straight up dips in the span of twenty seconds",
        "Awesome! ",
        "I CAN'T BELIEVE STEVE IS DEAD",
        "WHAT!",
        "He just killed em and that was that holy shit.",
        "Vampires win!?!?!?!?!!!!",
        "Woah this is some of your best work yet Worthi! Great job love all you do <3",
        "I know WIRE has something to do with this, I knew the first time I saw bigtop burger (i still listen to the song it's great)",
        "Im now so interested to see how much Cesare truly does/doesnt care for his employees, I love the Zomburger dynamics so much",
        "I love how Cesare turns into a pole on a hinge when he presents the hat. BEHOLD, THE BIG STETSON!",
        "Wait... Hold on... Dealing with you freakazoids? Upper managment? Magical hammer? ... OMFG WIRE IS CANNON IN THIS UNIVERSE?! THE FAN THEORIES WERE REAL?!",
        "Hey your music in this episode is SO good. Like it's always good but the song when Cesare brings out the hammer rules!!!",
        "Is the concept that Steve is a heavingly angel disguised as a clown and caeser is a demon from the underworld.",
        "There's LORE???????????",
        "Everybody remembers the first time they find out their boss is some sort of supernatural entity tasked with wiping out a species of clowns",
        "I live for these videos",
        "THE SNAP AND REVEAL. STEVE STRUGGLING. CAESARES DEAD PAN \"Yeah. Thats the point\" AND TRACKING SHOT OF HIS WEAPON (and a tracking shot than wraps around the setting in a semi circle too!!!!)!!! Its perfect!!! I want this tattooed on my brain!!!!!",
        "I need a full version of the song that plays when Cesare hammers Steve. I need it so damn bad.",
        "Fav line and a thing I wish more villains would say\n\"Yeah, that's the point\"",
        "I\u2019m getting MAJOR FLCL vibes from this episode, I just love each and every one of these when they come out, and the music as always is just a knockout.",
        "I honestly can't wait another several months (I will if I have to) for the next episode. A cliff hanger like this is making me scream",
        "I can't believe this whole series was just a long con by Cesare.",
        "0:25 That might be the sickest burns in Animation history",
        "Apparently in the Worthikids cinematic universe, the undead have mastered the extending spiral pole tech from the Wire, used by the freaking SWAT clowns",
        "In the end he faced off with the faceless (everybody else wears makeup, i.e. not their real face), and then literally vanished without traces.\nWhat an absolute lad.",
        "\"I still have ONE MORE GIFT....TO GIVE YOU!!!\"  love the pause",
        "At this point, it may as well all be connected to Wire and Witch Tinder. I have no idea where any of this leads.",
        "HECK YEAAAHHH finally, my dose of clowns, Weirdness and Absolute GOD TIER songs",
        "I adore Cesare's little victory dance before he absolutely smites Steve",
        "Can smb explain the \"albatross across your clavicle\" part",
        "Nobody is talking about the 7 month break before a 3 minute clip this animation is way too good to keep us in wait like this I understand masterpieces take time but fuck man I would make a go fund me page for a tv show of this",
        "Oh man, Chris Flemming is absolutely killing it as Cesare",
        "Cesare noting the cost of the kettlebells while at the same time paying thousands of dollars per hour to his employees",
        "Nice song",
        "Worth the 6 month wait",
        "WAIT A FUCKIN SECOND\nDoes the line \"I don't normally need help catching you freakazoids\" mean that Cesare is a CLOWN HUNTER?!! HE CATCHES CLOWNS, THAT'S HIS JOB",
        "I had no idea Cesare was trying to capture Steve, I genuinely though his whole plan was to inconvenience him with incresingly heavy gifts",
        "what if steve is a escaped convict wanted to live among the humans \nand opened up burger joint\nand cesare was sent by boss\nto capture steve",

        "Now this is a shonen",
        "The music in this episode is the best so far",
        "Eye on the wire but I won't trip it!!!!",
        "This is animated beatifully\nThe voice acting is stellar\nThe writing is exquisite\nDefinitely worth the wait",
        "I'm so glad I got this in my recommended. I wish I did sooner.",
        "Holy shit, does this tie into \"Wire\" at all!?!",
        "the plot thickens",
        "Literally always worth the wait. Good job Ian1",
        "i love that frances looks up when cesare mentions \"upper management\", then down when they realize cesare is actually pointing down",
        "What are the lyrics that are sung while Cerare slams steve to who knows where?",
        "Oh I really hope they make more episodes to finish season 2 of Bigtop Burger, this episode threw me through a loop. I so did not expect that to happen at all.",
        "You gotta admit all of us were both in awe and shock during this episode",
        "steve! Steve!! STEVE!!!",
        "It's so FUCKin cool to see Cesare show his abilities and tactic. This episodeal masterpiece will go far.",
        "Can we talk about how Cesare was easily carrying those heavy items?",
        "The animation in this is amazing. The way you animated the crews reaction to Steve getting hit with the hammer is so smooth and satisfying. You are my absolute favorite animator on youtube!",
        "I've watched this episode like a solid 6 or 7 times and then rewatched the series again and again god dam you good! \nHonestly dude mad respect, that Switch in this episode is superb. Perfect timing and the way you build up to things just magic.",

        "Wait is this part of the wire video?",
        "DUDE being able to watch a masterpiece that is this episode after half of a HELLISH week I've been having is like finding $50 after I've been violently thrown into a dumpster",
        "Man no wonder cesare is the new face of the channel. Everything he does and says is pure gold. What an awsome villan",
        "YAY PART 2!!! THAN YOUUU",
        "Realizing this is connected to Wire (More than likely) for the first time O.O",
        "Cant wait for the lore and story theory videos while we wait for the next episode. Whole undead vs clowns is so amazing",
        "That remix of Down starting at 2:30 goes so fucking HARD",
        "THE BIG STETSON!",
        "I wonder if the hole Cesare makes after hitting Steve is connected to the hole Conrad saw at the start of the season.",
        "This show is hilarious, and also perfectly showcases how much anxiety I feel when I get an unwanted gift.",
        "THIS YOUTUBER IS A LEGEND!!",
        "So, uh, why didn't he just drop the \"lunchbox\"?",
        "Bruh this show be awesome 10 outta twn keep it comin!!!!",
        "Wait a minute! The extendo pole thing that cesare uses is in the \"Wire\" short that Worthikids made but the one using it is a CLOWN. I think they caught the other ninja clown gang and are using their tech!",
        "This would make a killer adult swim tv show. In all honesty there should be need more outlandish series like this",
        "Damn, good music",
        "Bloody perfect episode! Love this",
        "I mean, this explains why Steve always seems so unnerved whenever Cesare shows up. But who is upper management and are we certain this has nothing to do with Wire??",
        "I could SO watch 4 seasons of this, the facial expressions are amazing and Cesare's demeanor is so funny!",
        "Please for the love of god make posters of your creations and MERCH LOTS OF MERCHANDISE",
        "I really wish I could see a full length TV series of this, it's golden",
        "Would it be a bad idea if a send this to my bf saying \"us \ufe0f\"???",
        "even though it's a little youtube mini-series, the talent and charm this show has is astounding. Worthi you are legendary and I pray that nothing muddles your creative direction here. You take your time and work your magic!",
        "This was an incredible episode! Love that style when Cesare crushed steve along with that music!! a great feel to it!",
        "God Chris Fleming is such a good voice actor. I love his improvisations and how well he plays Cesar.",
        "What Conrad said about where they got their money makes a lot more sense now.",
        "So wait does mean Wire is also apart of this universe?",
        "I feel like worthikids could make a Netflix series out of this and I absolutely love it",
        "bro this is not bad. i dont watch anime",
        "going back and rewatching \"wire\" after looking at how this ended really leaves you with some questions about the timeline of this whole thing",
        "STEVE NOOO",
        "Okay, the animation is gorgeous and smooth in occasionally unnerving ways, but I am still impressed at how well it compliments and enhances the dialogue.\n\u201cTim\u2026 look at him.\u201d\n\u201cFelix Navidad, my good friend.\u201d",
        "ahhh\nso it all ties back to the Wire in the end. Lol",

        "ligma",
        "This is the first episode I saw come up on my feed randomly and I was so intrigued that I\u2019ve watched every episode \u2026 3 times. And this one is SO FRICKEN COOL! I get energized just watching it again! \nEverything was \u201con point\u201d! ",
        "as always its masterpiece of comedy and storytelling\namazing art",
        "As someone who works in animation, Bigtop Burger is incredibly refreshing. This show never tries to be anything that it's not, and with that, just so happens to be one of the best shows out there. It's not a super-polished series from a huge moneymaking streaming service, and it's perfectly good on it's own without needing that gloss and shimmer. It's a 3D animated show that feels like it's in traditional 2D, and it uses it's style to a huge advantage and isn't afraid to bend and twist things a bit. Bigtop Burger gives me hope for indie animation.",
        "MORE",
        "Love the way the crowd's clothing fluttered intensely after the shockwave from the hammer, and gradually stopped moving. Great action detail. Love your work!",

        "Omg I'm invested this is hype",
        "Fuck, man, everything about this is sick as hell and the music absolutely makes it. Can we just appreciate the fact that the version of 'Down' we get in this has a fucking KEY CHANGE? Such a killer episode.",

        "Top five anime battles",
        "I mean it was a nice hat",

        "This episode is absolutrly mind-blowing. I love how the series' going! Excellent job. Awesome artstyle",
        "This series saved me from the throes of deepest despair. Thank you. Love clowns now",
        ".....wtf just happened here??????",
        "Throughout this season, I never expected Cesare to become the albatross across Steve's clavicle, but here we are.",
        "HELL YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAA",
        "Was not ready for that,at all",

        "peak\nm",
        "WHAT! What a twist! How long has the plot been going on? Feels like this is over a pretty short amount of time. The Bigtop clowns didn't know their boss that well. And all the LORE!\nThere was some awesome motion and some freakish expressions this episode too. Oh man oh man, I just wanna see more! Dang, you're good :D",
        "what makes that little clown so special...who is he...i am so intrigued",
        "1:19 \u201cBehold! The Big Stetson! \u201d Honestly my favorite part for no reason other than Cesare.",
        "This just further proves that the 'Wire' video has canon connections to Big Top, people who weren't 100% sure about it can be fucking certain now.",
        "Where can I listen to that song from the hammer scene???",
        "Anyone else think the child saved in the wire video is Steve and it all plays off the other world",
        "The scariest part about this is that now they're all unemployed. In this economy no less ",
        "bro steve got fucking obliterated",
        "This needs to be commissioned knri a Netflix series",
        "That hammer sequence would explain why it took so long for this to come out.\nAbsolutely marvelous!",
        "YESS, YOURE BACK!!",

I know he probably recorded the whole thing over again because when he did it two years ago it had the same lyrics but I don't even think he used the lyrics in an episode till now so clearly he's not apposed to recording the whole thing just to use a snippit!",

Unlike other subjects, who either confessed to whatever the charges were or claimed innocence to their death, Corey refused to plead altogether, just responding to the interrogator \"more weight\". Unsurprisingly, he eventually died.",

The extension of the handle, the slight growth of the hammer's head until it quickly 'pops' into full size, the two-frame slamming of the hammer, the scene color switch, the rippling wind of the high-quality characters' hair (and hat), the perfectly lit scene/characters by the lightning, the slow-motion propulsion of the trucks, I mean it's all insanely beautiful. For someone who doesn't work in animation, the entire show, and especially this episode, has amazing graphical effects and meaning behind each element.
