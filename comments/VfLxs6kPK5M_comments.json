        "The problem with the open with and performance issues was due to the day 1 patch not being out at the time, and people playing hacked versions of the games",
        "@gameexplain Quick Question: If this game wasn't Pokemon, would you guys really give it the score \"Like it alot\"? These performance issues are immersion breaking to a huge degree. The world looks pretty bad and uninteresting. Anyway, love the channel. Keep up the good work.",
        "No excuse for the poor performance in the open world. Especially when you look at games like XC3.",
        "As someone who has never played any pokemon game, all I can say is that this looks incredibly bare bones and the graphics/textures are really ugly.",
        "Is it me, or did I keep seeing a shiny Golduck pop up?",
        "Great review, but in regards to the performance issues did you play this on the version one or with the patch ?",
        "That first game was the best game ever watched",
        "I was worried about performance turning me off, but it seems they did that great with everything else enough for me to make the leap lol",
        "Everyone forgets to give the new the pokedex entry photos and hand-drawn ui (sprites, objects etc) the spotlight they deserve \ud83e\udee3",
        "How many school uniform costume changes do we get?",
        "The game is broken. It's absurd that Nintendo/Pok\u00e9mon Company decided to release the game in this state charging full price.\n\nIs the Cyberpunk 2077 situation all over again.",
        "Can't believe you thought the designs for the new Pok\u00e9mon are good.",
        "Big bummer about the performance issues. Though was pretty expected",
        "A region having multiple champions kind of takes awe out of the title champion, only One super bad ass per country please",
        "That \"I'm free\" quote at the end really hits different after his passing. Rest in peace, Techno. You will be missed dearly.",
        "It's a bit ugly.",
        "Looks and performs like a mobile game ",
        "I feel like treastilizeing is way better than giagantamax, it more interesting. but that's just me. ",
        "Can we just appreciate how much of time and work he spends on making videos to entertain us?",
        "It looks as though Game Freak is quickly becoming Nintendo's Bethesda... XD",
        "It\u2019s upsetting to hear that the gym leader battles don\u2019t scale to the current level; to me why even allow us to battle them in any order in the first place if the levels are predetermined and imply a set order.",
        "Saddens me that Nintendo and Game Freak just can't accept that they need to invest in more powerful tools be it new hardware or game engines. It is becoming a bit of a joke now about how badly the games perform and look in certain areas. Nintendo only gamers may not know what they are missing out on and I'm not even asking for 60FPS or 120FPS modes, but when you also play on PS5 and see how games can run like Horizon FW or God of War Ragnarok then it just makes you think what this game can really be. Gameplay and design choices like the implementation of the open world is subjective and it might be for you or might not be - but a game simply not meeting modern standards of a stable framerate is just inexcusable now.",
        "Big pass for me on this. The performance issues are one thing, but S/V just don't do anything impressive. Legends Arceus was more of a step away from the usual formula. I think I'll wait for the next legends game. Mainline pokemon games just don't do it anynore.",
        "Getting violet",
        "Yall remember when Tim used to body roll when he got a sub/dono? DJ TURN IT UP!",
        "Why Gamefreak Why dont you learn how to manage the framerate!!! Why!!!",
        "I love these games they were awesome ",
        "I just bought the game before this review came out. I shouldve waited. ",
        "Is it just me or do the graphics look rougher than PLA?",
        "Bruh...since you did like this game. It has a lot of issues and the game sucks as hell.",
        "Played it on Emulator a week before and I thought the issues where Emulated related. Played it today on real hardware and boy oh boy I considering getting a refund.",
        "Oof, gamefreak what\u2019s goin on with your optimization there buddy?",
        "Sick of the furry pokemon",
        "\"it's the largest world of pokemon world, and yet the most emptiest\"",
        "Do you play on regular switch or the portable switch with out removable handles",
        "Time to release a more powerful console Nintendo",
        "\"Liked a lot\"",
        "Eh considering this is the first true open world Pok\u00e9mon bugs are a given considering this is a journey for the developers and players and I for one can\u2019t wait to start my new journey November 30th\n11/19/22 Edit: updated opinion upon checking with a trusted gaming news channel 24 hours after release I will be keeping a more analytical eye on the state of this game and it\u2019s graphical stability due to a chilling feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu",
        "But ur gameplay review is before day 1 patch correct",
        "Reviews are getting worse and worse, this is obviously not a pc so why waste time mentioning the obvious \n\n\nIs it works of art that people spend their time on so why the hell did you spend like this whole review complaining about things that we never had another games",
        "Three years since Sword and Shield. The textures and animations still look so terrible. Still no full dex or voice acting. \nTo think three years ago some fans were optimistic GameFreak would fix the games with patches post release. ",
        "good vid but i feel your threshold for \"good\" is far far far too low for what pokemon should be by now....\n\nhave decided to buy violet a month ago but my expectations have been HEAVILY tempered",
        "Pokemon scarlet more like Sonic Unleashed",
        "Ign is gonna give it a 5/10",
        "you caught your lead Pokemon in a great ball. if you change your lead Pokemon the ball in the entryway will change to whatever you caught it in. if I had to guess, it may relate to how they spawn your Pokemon for the \"lets go\" feature since you can't use that feature inside building",
        "The speed lines on a literal rock at 12:56 cracks me up.",
        "I really wish nintendo would step in and get this to run better. This is a really bad look for pokemon and Nintendo. Like who signed off on this performance?",
        "It's probably just bad luck in your game that you're experiencing those issues because mostly everyone else who has played it didn't complain as much as you have. Hopefully they will have updates to fix said bug issues.",
        "I'll give the game another try today, but last night I was disappointed by how slow the movement of the game was that I nodded off. Granted, I was tired, so hopefully that feeling doesn't remain when I play the game later today. But even when I figured out how to run/jog, the movement speed seemed a tad slow to me.",
        "Gurl you nerds played the old version, mine works fine, you're just haters",
        "It\u2019s 2022, time for GF to get it together! Next main game which will probably be on the next main console needs better graphics and performance. But can\u2019t wait to play as well.",
        "Do they test/play their own game before they release it.....? Or do they just say F it, they can deal with 15 fps in the year 2022.....??? Unbelievable...",
        "Theres also a 1 gig day one patch, so.",
        "Dammmn. What happened between SV and LofA.... This is a bit rough GameFreak...",
        "Yea, the technical issues I was completely expecting. The Legends game preformed better then this and could handle more Pok\u00e9mon on screen. It could be because there are more assets to load in S & V then there was in legends. In regards to that Great Ball spawning in when you walk in a building, it is more likely a reference point for the developers to know where the player would spawn in when the room loads. Usually those kind of things are hidden from the player, but if you see it happening on a regular basis, that means the dev team overlooked quite the glaring detail ",
        "The game seems almost perfect. I\u2019m just hoping for them to fix the performance issues in later updates. Mainly just so everyone will stop trashing the game because of it. Guys. Graphics. Don\u2019t. Make. A. Game. Sure, I wish they were better, but it doesn\u2019t put the game off for me. They\u2019ll release some sort of patch eventually.",
        "For me the game is unplayable\u2026 it\u2019s to laggy\u2026 gives the feeling of walking with 50 pounds on your back, the character is heavy. Not to mention moving the camera is choppier and stuttering. Sad but true ",
        "framerate switch",
        "This is the first pokemon game i'm going to watch someone play online and not buy myself.",
        "oh no...somekind of reminded me of cyberpunk with the performance issues....",
        "The Assassins Creed Unity of Pokemon! lol",
        "Very informative",
        "I WAS SCARED OF THE EAR ONE THANK'S FORRR THAAAT!!!!",
        "I love the game if u expected it to run like a game on ps5 that\u2019s your fault this game is amazing they did everything correct it\u2019s completely immersive and addicting I\u2019ve had 0 performance issues with my oled but I also always play handleheld literally every game besides mario party has performance issues when played docked ",
        "Billion dollar company and yet they make games that look like ps2 graphics and can't even get a stable 30 fps on it. But yeah it's Pokemon so nobody cares and will still sell 20+ million copies.",
        "Worst Generation",
        "The reset your view behind the player button is L.",
        "I will miss not having the ability to chuck pokeballs, outside of battles, to catch Pokemon.",
        "I feel like the review could have taken a moment to mention that *there is no clothing option other than the four uniforms*, because GameXplain, you said, and I quote: \"Outside of academy uniforms, there is a ton of clothing customization, it seems like the most than any pokemon game so far. Players can purchase and wear different *shirts*, shoes, gloves, hats, socks, backpacks, and even different phone cases. \" As it turns out, no you cannot wear a different shirt, or anything outside of the 4 uniforms. Every pokemon game (that had customization at all) since X/Y back in 2013 (which means, all of them except OR/AS) had real clothing customization. This is a massive downgrade that will not be obvious until after you've bought the game. Buyers deserve to be informed before they make a purchase, that's what the review is supposed to be for.",
        "looks like a gamecube port that runs like flaming garbage   we should just not buy it so the developer learns to not release crap games every 7 months",
        "So Nemona is more of a mentor than a rival... noted.",
        "Ive been a massive pokemon fan in my youth. I remember when my dad bought pokemon heartgold and together with the DS. That was my happiest moment as child. Sadly, pops passed away and I never had the chance to buy pokemon again due to financial struggles as someone who works minimum job. Still happy that my cousin gave me his switch lite to play free to play games now and then. I'll be buying switch games when times get ease. Miss you pops, and thank you for the childhood memory that i will never forget...",
        "LOOKS BEAUTIFUL! But please fix the FPS GameFreak!! ",
        "This is utterly pathetic from this company.",
        "Which version did you play 1.0.0 or 1.0.1? Which switch did you use?",
        "Aight bet. Play in portable mode til patch",
        "Because I'm happy\nClap along if you feel like happiness is the truth .\nI love these games already",
        "GF straight up charging full price for an unoptimized beta lol",
        "I can't wait to get these games question do the version of the game you got come with the day 1 patch or no?",
        "After you said rightfully intimidating in regards to the league I got a Sonic Frontiers ad that just made me think omg imagine if this game also had metalcore boss music lol",
        "Will only buy IF they patch out the performance issues. I don't think the gamecube graphics are going anywhere though...",
        "How are we getting a game that looks this terrible visually in 2022 ",
        "After watching several reviews today, the pop in and frame rate issues are pretty distracting. While I get the Switch is aging and we seriously need a Pro model to bump up those framerates and load ins (Hyrule Warriors needed it way before now!), Game Freak are once again sadly showing their budget and staffing doesn't match the quality and depth the franchise should be getting as the biggest in the world. Sonic Forces can make excuses as lower down the ladder in profits and sales, Pokemon simply can not...",
        "The cat will stand",
        "Ima skip this one again ",
        "it literally looks worse than swsh and LA WTAF",
        "6:33 simp to the rescue, no one cares about a friendly rival, we want a rival that talks trash and is actually good at Pok\u00e9mon battles like Blue.",
        "17:55 \"Strangely enough, the performance issues are less prevalent in handheld mode\".....You're kidding right? This has been a running theme with Switch games since the system released. Performance has traditionally been better in handheld mode, likely due to the Switch's CPU clock speeds staying the same regardless of whether you're handheld or docked and the memory clock not being increased enough when docked. It'd be stranger if performance was the ",
        "Imagine pokemon on the ps5 and series x performance",
        "The way u speak of nemoa reminds me of Bianca and Hugh",
        "The transition from the Pixar lamp to the boat train, that was incredible",
        "Are you guys playing on the first version 1.0.0?",
        "Just so everyone knows the day one patch came out days ago so every reviewer has played with it installed. This is the performance after the day one patch. It was even worse before",
        "Press the L button to reset your camera angle. 4:05",
        "It is a tradition in the Paldean region to leave a Pokeball at the door... to ward off VAMPIRES!",
        "I am going to wait til a patch comes out... which sucks",
        "Sorry to ask but\u2026 Is there anything to actually do when you\u2019re exploring? Besides catch and battle Pok\u00e9mon? Open world sounds great on paper, but I don\u2019t see the appeal if there aren\u2019t reasons to actually explore the world except to hit the main objectives.",
        "Nice",
        "Note\n\nU can also refill ur terra orb by touching the raid crystal (u don\u2019t need to enter the raid)",
        "As much as I would like to play this I can't for the life of me in 2022 play something with sub par performance",
        "Tris over here showing off their shiny Golduck.",
        "Yeah I was going to grab day one but I will wait for them to iron out the bugs and hopefully have a more polished experience in 6 months or so",
        "I don't know they didn't ask Nintendo or Monolith Soft for help... Game Freak is hurting their reputation.",
        "So they never explained what coop will be like?",
        "Great\u2026.everyone favorite fear  ",
        "Definitely not getting it like it this\u2026 I\u2019ll wait for a patch though my hopes are low\u2026",
        "this game is a tragedy. 9/10 game with 1/10 performance",
        "I really hope we get a patch to fix the performance issues. I really hope GameFreak smooths out their optimization in the future.",
        "First!",
        "Hi Tris great review. I will be getting this tomorrow",
        "Genuinely don't know how Pokemon is the only franchise on the switch that hasn't figured out how to optimize their games for a somewhat stable performance.\n\nIt looks like it runs worse or just as bad as Rune Factory 5, and that was made by a small dev team.",
        "there is going to be a day one patch fixing alot of the performance issues",
        "Still looks pretty boring.",
        "Catch \u2018em all at 4fps",
        "Looks like a generation I\u2019ll be skipping. My last Pok\u00e9mon game I bought was sword.",
        "Something that people should know is that while yes the performance could be better it's not anywhere near as bad as people are saying it is. I've had my game slow down slightly but only for a few seconds and never anything too bad. That also being said pop in and terrible animations in background characters are very noticeable. People are complaining as much as they are because it's gamefreak/pokemon.",
        "The only issue I find with the whole Gyms having freedom of choice, what\u2019s the point of challenging the \u201cfinal or hardest\u201d gym first cause once you beat them the game is just easy since they don\u2019t scale to your lvl right?",
        "probably the worse part of S/V is deff how the online battle timer's still 20 minutes just like in bdsp and sword and shield.\nthat literally just kills players who want to play competitive 6v6. I've no doubt everyone will complain about this, unless they've just accepted it, which is actually really sad, cuz that really needs to be changed back to 60 mins.",
        "The switch is absolutely adequate. If it can handle BOTW and a stripped back witcher 3, it should be able to handle a blocky effort like this. I mean...it doesn't look too different from Ape Escape 2 on PS2. Just a terrible terrible company regurgitating and empty, unambitios and predictable title again and again. ",
        "this intro is going to give someone a seizure i think",
        "Thank god I\u2019m a competitive player and I don\u2019t have to worry about anything in game.",
        "Game freak needs to figure out their issues with working on Nintendo hardware\u2026.",
        "That microwave one is just too real, I really felt it when it went mmmmmmmmmmmmBbmmbmbmbmmmmbbmmmmmmmmm DING",
        "I really wanted to love this and it does look fun, but the performance issues are just too hard to ignore. A few issues here and there is forgivable, but from the footage I\u2019ve seen it looks really distracting. There\u2019s just no excuses for it anymore. So disappointing.",
        "I can't wait to be playing these games tonight at midnight.",
        "Let's just blame alot of the optimization issues on the console. I'm sure pokemon would shine hard af on any other console",
        "It's time ",
        "I like the game a lot besides the performance issues. I\u2019ve been playing Scarlett for 2 days and Im having wayyy more fun than I did with legends. Not saying legends wasn\u2019t good, it just wasn\u2019t for me.",
        "I recently finished Metroid Prime. That game is 20 years old and looks better than this.",
        "at 4:00, you mentioned the lack of reset view button, isn't the \"L\" button reset your view?",
        "Is the first gen starters in this game. I want charmander and bulbasaur",
        "Not loving it but in the end still liking it a lot, thats the whole problem people keep giving this good ratings despite of the laziness of GameFreaks, if we keep doing that, they will never step up there game.",
        "I honestly wish they could let us have the ability to jump while playing as the trainer. It just feels weird being restricted with no ability to even have a tiny jumping possibility. Hopfully the next game will have it...",
        "If bugs and glitches that are very likely to be fixed in updates are the biggest issues, then im not worried ^_^",
        "I can't take this review seriously after he said the new designs are great. Every single new pokemon sucks",
        "Yoo",
        "disgustingly bad they need to abandon this garbage engine they are using its at most worth 30 bucks",
        "I really miss 2d Pok\u00e9mon games I really wish they didn\u2019t abandon them completely should\u2019ve went the route Zelda went by making both types. They could\u2019ve made some super pretty 2d Pok\u00e9mon games with the tech they have now compared to the bland play dough looking 3d games",
        "The great ball is probably a programming thing to indicate where the entrance of a building is for you to spawn on.. but it shouldn't be visible if so",
        "Intro too good",
        "temtem exists, don't settle for less\ndon't get this game\njust more half steps, not worth it",
        "Im kinda disappointed as to how many Performance issues there seem to be. Everything else in the game looks great though im excited to get my copy!",
        "I'm not sure why they don't make the style of graphics cel shaded like the cartoon. I feel like it would be easier to do that style and hide blemishes and keep performance up.",
        "I hate map and mini map.  They really need to put fix rotation on the mini map.",
        "They should just make one huge game with every gen Pok\u00e9mon",
        "Game freak needs to grow up and make a game like Pokken graphics with mechanics from BOTW or RDR2.",
        "When a day 1 patched game still feels like an alpha release. Even matches the previews where the game still were janky and had bad performance",
        "Impossible impossible impossible",
        "Yea we\u2019re kinda due for a switch pro now",
        "I dont think gym badges matter in terms of catching pokemon, but maybe how disciplined they are like ignoring orders, I caught a lvl 39 pokemon when my highest was 34 at the time and only had 2 badges.",
        "Can player character walk barefoot?",
        "It\u2019s almost like Gamefreak is physically incapable of polishing a game in the time they are given to make it and that fact will never change as long as the games keep selling.",
        "Even though it may be a bit on the choppy side sometimes, it\u2019s not going to bother me. I can look past it to enjoy what I know will be my game of the year. A patch or two would be good though. I know it can do better.",
        "Performance Issues really don\u2019t seem like too big a deal\u2026 well, at all, really. It\u2019s a Pok\u00e9mon game, it\u2019s not like you\u2019ll be making precise maneuvers or forced to have quick reactions, it\u2019s an RPG, after all.\n\nPlus, they\u2019ll likely polish the game up more and fix bugs, especially with a Day One Update.",
        "Well than, thanks to the open world stuff, lack of proper scaling and STILL missing ingame support for challenge runs... this will be the first Pokemon game I am not going to buy !",
        "I need to ask because this video confuses me: Can you create an older avatar? I thought you only have the option to play as the pre-schooler from the trailers, but here in the video the avatar looks much taller. Can someone explain? Thx.",
        "Gamefreak is a disaster. It\u2019s such a shame that they don\u2019t dedicate the care and resources to fixing their performance issues. This is the flagship product in the most valuable franchise in the world.",
        "Pokemon Scarlet and Violet looks good on the surface, like most Pokemon past Titles, however it doesn't really appeal to me atm . Might see if they have a demo first before purchasing on day 1",
        "This is the 3rd large scale Pokemon game on consoles. You would\u2019ve thought they had the optimization issues figured out by now. It\u2019s almost as if they didn\u2019t even care to play test the games enough before a release. Hoping they can patch the issues. Still looking forward to playing through the game.",
        "The gen already needs its remakes ",
        "I\u2019m hoping next Pok\u00e9mon game will look more like Sword and Shield in terms of art style. And they fix all the performance problems",
        "Pokemon Bethesda edition",
        "Let\u2019s keep in mind he played beta version of the game. 1.1.1 update will be available to play on the 18th.",
        "This game will probably play better on PC when it gets hacked over to it.",
        "The randome Greateball spawning im every doorway is the kind of funny randome glitch i love xD like ... How !?",
        "Nintendo really needs a new console.. its getting hard to look at these games. they look worse than mobile",
        "Yo Nogla, the guy that made the one backrooms game (the one with that party area that you guys were stuck on with wildcat) it\u2019s being updated with new levels and some redesigns. It seems like you might enjoy a 2nd go round with it, but I dunno, it\u2019s up to you guys.",
        "Imagine setting an picnic on a flamable place with the \u201cthis is fine\u201d meme ",
        "It\u2019s sad that Gamefreak can\u2019t do things right the first time around, especially given how huge Pok\u00e9mon is, it\u2019s really hard to imagine that they missed all of these game bugs, it\u2019ll all get fixed hopefully pretty soon with game patches, although they shouldn\u2019t have to patch as much as they do, but the games still look really amazing, and I am very excited to play these games at the midnight release tonight.",
        "That wasnt a punt it was a kickoff",
        "There is a camera rest button",
        "I wonder what dlc be like what there did in Pok\u00e9mon sword shield  I hope there have the anime for Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet and Violet",
        "Nice and thoughtful Review.  \n\nBut yea, while I love this game and the sheer delight many of its explorative moments can bring - I am a little embarassed by its Performance quite a lot of the times as I'm playing through it and need to chill to some of the Great music to make me forget about it lol.",
        "The graphics/design/performance are a total deal breaker for me. I'm sure the open world concept is better but I'm gonna wait for a new switch and hope the next pokemon runs and looks better.",
        "It is important for many reviews to seriously address the performance issues. GameFreak seriously needs to take action in releasing a performance fix patch. \n\nI know they have a reputation of not listening to their audiences and I used to believe that. ",
        "29 on trending on a dying channel lol",
        "Nope. Can't do it. Can't get on board with a motorcycle pokemon. They crossed the line.",
        "After playing Xenoblade 3 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to blame the switch for these performance issues even breath of the wild. This is a game, freak issue.",
        "I am starting to think if this game had no performance issues we\u2019d probably be looking at an average review score of like 86 it feels",
        "@4:00 If you tap/hold the L button it centers the camera behind you just FYI",
        "I spy a shiny Golduck. Nice subtle flex.",
        "These games are open world but not true open world because true open world Pokemon game would have every region and every single pokemon in 1 game so all 9+ regions so yes it may be open world but it is not yet true open world",
        "4:04 there is in fact a button to auto put camera behind the player. Its the L button/bumper.\n\nLmao error 4:04 and L",

Like an ice Pok\u00e9mon that can freeze objects or water or use your fire Pok\u00e9mon to burn rope to release a platform or an electric one that can either add or take away charge or power from machines or lights to reveal areas. Seems like you could do that on a fairly basic level like it's not even that far from something like the Lego games where each character has an ability that can be used to solve puzzles but the potential to do that with Pok\u00e9mon could be amazing.",
        "I can already hear the fan of my switch",

It sounds like the kind of lag that, while not necessarily pleasant to look at, doesn't make the game outright unplayable. Lag is a much worse issue in live online multiplayer because that's where it makes games outright unplayable, or if it takes a whole minute to load what's five feet in front of your character, and if that's what's happening, then yes, those evil people at Game Freak that regularly commit the unforgivable sin of physically and psychologically harming longtime Pokemon fans by having a budget to make their games with on the Nintendo Switch need to step it up. As far as I'm concerned, however, with everything else you loved about the game, lag's not too different of a criticism from \"too much water,\" and for all intents and purposes, you gave Pokemon Scarlet and Violet a perfect score.",

It\u2019d be funny if they actually forgot to do this because wow",

The legend of zelda breath of the wild, Xenoblade Chronicles 3, Dragon quest XI and Starfox: starlink battle for atlas are all open world games that look and run smoothly on the Switch.  The reason why this game underperforms is because game freak still isn't used to working on console games...... They honestly need to outsource to Namco.",

        "I have no issue with the core gameplay with the game (outside of no level scaling). The performance is the thing that\u2019s really embarrassing about this game. You can\u2019t tell me they made the game look and work like this after BOTW came out 5 years ago on the same system",
        "Im really hoping this is the best game in the post-renaissance era Pokemon and a turnabout for the series, and to that end I can already tell the game is better than SwSh at least and I will always be a little bit happy to see things improve instead of continuing to become worse, but to be fair that is already a pretty low hanging fruit. With all the reoccurring steps backwards like EXP.Share, Trainer Customization, Online systems, and quite embarrassingly, performance, I hope that the steps forward, few and far between, are hefty enough to make the difference.",
        "I'm going to wait to see if patches are released but what is the history of Gamefreak releasing updates?",
        "It seems like the devs overused copy/paste in this game. Every NPC and every building looks exactly the same. Every mission is exactly the same. Looks like a 2/10 pokemon game.",

        "beginning of game was agonizing with all the talking, you talk for 3 hrs, game allows you to take 5 very slow steps then talk again for 3 more hrs. i hate the whole school setting. you can hardly see the pokemon in the field they\u2019re so small. then after literally an hr of nonsense the game finally gives you that motorcycle pokemon and it doesn\u2019t go much faster than running. all the new pokemon are really uninteresting. battle mechanics are a downgrade from arceus. pretty much hate all the characters. pokemon centers look like gas stations. this game sucks.",

        "The game looks really interesting. I'm just gonna wait for either a patch or a discount. I ain't paying full price for its current state.",

        "However, the game still offers the same as before... Battling, collecting items/Pok\u00e9mon and that's it. The lack of things to do in the open world is disappointing. No puzzles to solve, or actual dynamic interactions between Pok\u00e9mon in the wild... The game feels disconnected at times until you reach Area Zero which is probably the best portion of this game. The world isn't empty in terms of assets and Pok\u00e9mon models, but still lacking actual things to do other than what we've been doing for years now... The raids become repetitive, and there's actually nothing new to do in the overworld...",

No one expected them to do another Pok\u00e9mon game this year they easily could have pushed this another few months to a year even and most people would be fine with it. And the excuse of merch and anime doesn\u2019t really work cause the plush\u2019s have been out for months online and the tcg  does not come out til next year. The only reason I think they will even attempt to fix the performance issues is because it\u2019s supposed to be the VGC game for the next few years.",

Can't help but wish the Switch was a bit more powerful.  \n\nBefore anyone starts flaming me, obviously there's likely more GameFreak could have done in the performance department. But a lot of recent Switch games have been struggling with performance, Bayonetta 3, Sonic Frontiers, Mario+Rabbids 2, and those aren't even open world in the same sense Pokemon is. Not every dev is Monolith Soft, and open world is a hard game to pull off correctly on Switch, moreso if you're trying to pack it with lots of Pokemon.  Obviously it's possible, Breath of the Wild is a clear example of what a great engine can do. However, better hardware benefits everyone, the devs who are kings of optimization and the ones who struggle.",

        "A lack of polish is what you get when you release a game every single year! Overall, still a solid experience tho.",
        "Hmmm there must be a release day patch right? That great ball is just\u2026 unacceptable",
        "It's 2022, they really should've solved the graphical issues by now",
        "1:19 shiny Golduck? nice",
        "love the music choice in this review!",
        "Hubert\u2026 Brassius reminds me of Hubert from Fire Emblem.",
        "This is starting to tell me that the switch is getting out of date even for first party games",
        "Lmao STOP blaming the switch for the performance issues when it was GF being incompetent as usual. We have a lot of games that look better than pokemon and open world while also have a stable performance on switch",
        "ScVi looks like a dream come true except for the visual department.\n\nPoor performance is one thing but poor camera work is another. Camera clipping through bounds etc is incredibly frustrating esp in an open world.",
        "L button put camera behind you the slow down is real",
        "forget...",
        "Games not actually out though",
        "Performance issues are unacceptable for a Pok\u00e9mon game stop making excuses guys",
        "Yeah\u2026 for a world described in game as beautiful, it looked awfully meh.",
        "Did this man just say the new Pok\u00e9mon are good? I saw the list\u2026 98% we\u2019re so unbelievably bad idk who to even catch",
        "Why are people complaining so much it just came out like give nintendo some slack",
        "Correction: You CAN catch pokemon of higher levels, they will not listen to you in battles however. ALSO there is a button to reset the camera, both in the open world and in battle.",
        "100 billion dollar company that can't hire a few more devs to help optimize the game.  Sad",
        "Mobile games have better graphics \ufe0f",
        "Wow. Nintendo REALLY needs to release a 'NEW' Switch. Or Switch 2... This looks like a Gamecube game.",
        "another pokemon game? it feels like the last one was just released this year",
        "Just a little tip I want to give other people that will play, terra raid dens also recharge your terrastalization when you touch them.",
        "The amount of performance issues is worrying. If it was any other game other than pokemon, it wouldn't be released with such issues.",
        "I feel like we should mention that exploring can be tedious here too.  Many pokemon are so small, that you won't see them before running into them.  Flabebe is about as easy to spot as a mosquito IRL.",
        "If the performance issues make it hard to play the game I think you might need to go see a doctor as your brain is just not working right cyberpunk was much worse and people are enjoying it now Pokemon has issues yes but maybe stop and think this is the first open world Pokemon game it\u2019s more of a test to see how it works so in the future the issues should be much more streamlined",
        "The best Pokemon game in years.",
        "We need a switch pro",
        "Too bad I've already been playing it, needs a day 1 patch it struggles so bad with a stable framerate",
        "Is your review based upon the game BEFORE the day one patch? I assume that it is as others have mentioned that the patch removes/decreases any lag in the game. Either way though I\u2019m really excited for these games!",
        "I am a few hours into the game, and i really want to love it but the performance issues are just really annoying. I feel like if they took some extra time working on the game, it could have been a masterpiece. Hopefully a patch can clean up some of the bugs in the game, but part of me just wishes they took more time to polish the game.",
        "I pretty much solely play handheld, so I guess I'll still enjoy this! lol",
        "Why\u2019d you spoil that Nemona has champion rank, that was defined supposed to be a reveal towards the end of the game.",
        "We still don\u2019t have update yet that\u2019s tomorrow for performance",
        "Wait does he L button not reset the camera behind you?",
        "they really need to take pokemon away from game freak",
        "I think nintendo should start releasing, or quickly make another version of nintendo switch with improved performance (and battery) for about 100 bux more than current nintendo switch (like how they did with new 3ds)",
        "Honestly, the issues in the game are probably due to Nintendo, and in turn, The Pokemon Company and then GameFreak, pushing for the game to be released earlier then it should have. The Switch will probably be around for another 2 - 3 years or so, so it makes sense that they'd push the game to release now... but I can't help but imagine what this games would be like on Nintendo's next console.",
        "Great Review! Well structured, informative and honest! Thank you, Tris!",
        "Their setting up its first patch the day of release so for the visuals, cant really have a review on that yet.",
        "I'm confused, how is this any more open world than any other mainline pokemon game released ever? The lack of loading zones?",
        "\"There is no traffic jam along the extra mile.\" -Roger Staubach",
        "Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet and Violet are here soon, Im so hype for friday. ",
        "Performace has not been a prime aspect in pokemon so i dont mind it",
        "Cool!",
        "If the performance issues impacted the game so much that you couldn't say you love it\nYou're not a real Pokemon fan\n\nBut nonetheless, still excited myself.",
        "This game looks like absolute crap visually",
        "I want game freak to fire all of their coders",
        "Pok\u00e9mon is an annual series, we can expect some bad glitches becoming increasingly common until we hit a breaking point one year and they're forced to delay.",
        "If you have to unlock areas than the game isn't really open-world.\nYou know what Switch game is really open-world? Snowrunner!",
        "World's biggest franchise worth billions and they make a game that looks this bad.",
        "The performance issues are there because people were complaining abbout the graffix. Gamefresj has clearly focussen more on graffix and the pokemon campany just gives them not enough time. I personale don\u2019t care si nuchter abbout the graffix as long as the game is playable with almost no bugs or slowdowns.",
        "The number of people who didn't see the performance issues coming is too darn high. Look, it's Gamefreak. They're not great graphical developers to begin with, and they only have 2 3D titles under their belt. There was no way they were going to get this right.",
        "Is it out?",
        "remember MissingNo? that was a fun glitch that was forgivable  even of this game \nis fun this is still a technical  failure   in  2022!",
        "Why do I feel like the game is so rushed since legends arceus background looks better than S&V\u2026",
        "hoping if next year we got a revision for the switch, this game will also update for better fps",
        "If gamefreak capitalize on the successes of this game and iron out its flaws, the franchise will finally reach its true potential.",
        "What about the post game?",
        "I'm very surprised by the lack of criticism for the \"modernized\" dialogue. Like characters saying \"that's an L for me\" and other nonsense.",
        "I wonder if Ash will take the role of Nemona in the anime ",
        "Technical issues aside I\u2019m genuinely excited and can\u2019t wait to get my hands on this in three and a half hours when it launches here in Australia",
        "Did the day one patch improve performance at all?",
        "So the new Pokemon game basically became the Cyberpunk 2076 of Nintendo switch?  To many bugs and it should've spend more time on the oven baking. Maybe another 6 month?",
        "This game looks disgusting, there\u2019s no way around it.",
        "Give monolithsoft the entire game",
        "And y'all be complaining about Frontiers' Graphics..",
        "I believe there will be an day 1 patch and it\u2019s too be expected sadly all games will be buggy which they shouldn\u2019t be and fully tested so this doesn\u2019t happened but still even with these issues I will be enjoying Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet and Violet tomorrow. Also did it occur to you that the Greatball just liked following you around???? ",
        "But is it better than Arceus?",
        "Odyssey and Breath of the Wild are absolute masterpieces with a few hiccups here and there. How does it make any sense for Nintendo titles to be degrading in their quality instead of improving? I'm not overly interested in buying Nintendo Switch games these days because of the sheer lack of quality. It sucks because I used to love Nintendo back in the N64 Gamecube and Wii days.",
        "This game looks so unfinished\u2026but what do u expect with pokemon games",
        "3:44 \"Alot of characters in the screen\" \n\nOnly 4-6 people are being rendered and yet the game stutters like some insane stuff is happening on screen..",
        "I thought it released tomorrow\n\nMaybe I am wrong",
        "They need to ask a competent dev to make the open world in these games",
        "Can we stop using performance as a reason to lower a game review at least with Pok\u00e9mon it\u2019s something we are use to now we all need to learn to ignore it because everything else is solid",
        "Performance issues have never been a big issue for me (unless you get constant crashes) as as long as the game is fun and the the soundtrack is bangin\u2019 I\u2019m all good (and I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll get somewhat smoothed out over time)",
        "Ah, the GameFreak special. Cut content, performance issues, jank, lack of options, constant inconveniences, etc.",
        "I get the feeling these technical issues will get patched. They can't be unaware of the performance of these games, and the day 1 patch is going to require a big 1 GB in order to download it. Something tells me that they'll get taken care of.",
        "Is it true the open world, do things in whatever order you want is a lie? Im that, you gotta do certain events like team star bases before you can progress?",
        "The Yip game, of KND season 5 ep.9 had better performance (stability)\u2026.",
        "There is a button to reset behind you. L.",
        "Was there a day one patch when you played this? If not then maybe you should redo the review when you download it.",
        "Looking forward to the next two years of war zone 2 with jev :/",
        "Sad that people keep trashing Nintendo graphics. dokeV and palworld are killing Pokemon",
        "Thank you for being honest with this review. I feel like all of the problems you've experienced will be fixed. I think dlc might come for this game just like they did with pokemon sword and shield",
        "Great review! This sounds like it has faults but is still a good game! Looking forward to it",
        "Gamefreak should collab with Monolith Soft for their next mainline Pok\u00e9mon game.\nWould be amazing!"
