", "I just realized when he said \"I don't normally need help catching you freakazoids\" Cesare is referring to clowns, meaning that there really is some beef between spooky goth creatures and clowns going on", "I love how cesare is animated to perfectly match Chris's weird ass delivery of every line", "Hoping we'll be getting this version of DOWN (the song that plays while Cesare sends Steve to the Shadow Realm) to listen to. I swear it's different from the OG version, and it goes so damn hard.", "I always knew Conrad was a swol tank but didn\u2019t realize how strong he truly was until I noticed he was only one left standing by the end. The damn trucks even got knocked over", "i love how cesare's evil plan is literally to just weigh steve down with really heavy objects and then squish him with a hammer", "That Salem witch trial reference about Giles Corey is top tier. Good shit.\nEdit: After reading the comments, apparently Chris Fleming IMPROVISED that line. What a legend.", "I've re-watched from \"That's the point\" to Steve being a hole in the ground probably 100 times already. This might be one of the best pieces of media on the internet right now. The only problem is that we don't have enough of it.", "I adore Cesare's little victory dance before he absolutely smites Steve", "The fact that these are super short yet have such an impact like damn this guy knows how to write a story", "I love the fact that worthikids hid nothing about Steve and Cesare being \"different\" I was kinda hoping that the backpack and lunchbox was empty and the weight was just Steve being a literal clown though", "WAIT A FUCKIN SECOND\nDoes the line \"I don't normally need help catching you freakazoids\" mean that Cesare is a CLOWN HUNTER?!!

This show never tries to be anything that it's not, and with that, just so happens to be one of the best shows out there. It's not a super-polished series from a huge moneymaking streaming service, and it's perfectly good on it's own without needing that gloss and shimmer. It's a 3D animated show that feels like it's in traditional 2D, and it uses it's style to a huge advantage and isn't afraid to bend and twist things a bit. Bigtop Burger gives me hope for indie animation.", "i love this little show so much, i wish companies would hire more people like you to write and create their adult oriented animated shows.\nunironically all of the voice acting is stellar, everyone seems to be really putting their heart into it, the jokes are funny and also have some creativity and uniqueness. there\u2019s also the art style which i adore, awesome job all of you", "honestly the biggest plot twist the episode was that ceasare wasn't actually invested in the burger business or his crew, they were just a means to an end", "Having payed close attention to the lyrics of Down and Friends In Low Places, gotta say I wasn\u2019t surprised, but was still very excited to see this ancient rivalry come to fruition!\n\nEDIT: Also, I can\u2019t wait for Down (Reprise) to drop on worthikidsmusic!", "I'm lost for words.\nThe thought of the rabbit hole going deeper than we initially expected from this Food Truck themed series is beyond me... AND I LOVE IT", "Tim's obsession with the backpack and lunch box are hilarious.\n\nThe word \"stellar\" was animated perfectly.", "even though it's a little youtube mini-series, the talent and charm this show has is astounding. Worthi you are legendary and I pray that nothing muddles your creative direction here. You take your time and work your magic!", "Damn. The balls on this creator. I wasn't expecting him to seemingly kill off 9ne character and then entirely disappear another. Especially both leads. I'm truly intrigued now.", "can we just pause for a moment to appreciate that Cesare spent like 1.8K just to make steve stand still so he could hit him with a mallet lmfao", "Even though i was already expecting there to be some supernatural and magic stuff happening in this series, for some reason I still got shocked when it actually happened (in a good way).\n\nIt just feels so much like a chill slice of life thing (with some small hints of lore) then suddenly BAM an episode with a lot of magic and lore as the main thing ", "if these arent full songs already they absolutely need to be, and I can't stop watching this god damn", "This made me go back and watch a bunch of worthi's old vids and its really awesome to see how much he's grown as an animator over the last several years.", "The fact that at 1:57 the kettle bells get revealed in time with the music. AND THE LAST KETTLE BELL REVEALED ON A SYNCOPATED BEAT IS SO GOOD WJSNDKEJWJ\n\nThe fact that worthikids makes his own music is so fucking good, because he knows how to time his shots, movements, AND character expressions with it. What\u2019s even better is he knows his own music extremely well. DAMN props to you!!!", "I just moved to Texas and you BETTER BELIEVE I\u2019m gonna be shouting \u201cBEHOLD!

Thank you so much for making your music available on Apple Music. Hashtag blessed.", "I can't stop rewatching this video. The animation, the plot twist (Which feels so obvious now in hindsight) and the MUSIC! I'm smelling a reprise of \"Down\" coming soon and I'm gonna be listening to that so much if it gets released!", "such a cliff hangar. So glad to see this series alive and well, patience has been a virtue! Very excited to see the girls fight once more!!!!!!", "All that set up for the big reveal. Now we can finally get into the Clowns vs Undead story bits", "Cesare really stood out like a horseshoe crab in a freshwater environment this episode", "In less than 30 minutes, I fell in love with all the characters in this series. Truly outstanding talent.", "Oh man, I love these. Can this series get picked up by a studio?", "I just adore the way Penny says \"Woah, what a hat!\" Also I NEED a full version of the song that plays when Cesare is capturing Steve cause it is absolute fire.", "Love how Billie and Doc aren't super wide eyed at the end like everyone else. just sitting there like \"huh wow that just happened\"", "next episode, the two groups team up to rescue steve from hell", "I can't stop putting this on repeat. It's so dang awesome! Such a twist got me hooked into subscribing instantly. I can't wait to see what happens next!", "There are two things I love. 1) That I found Bigtop Burger again and there's no episodes. 2) Chris Fleming's energy with his work. Just getting that boom and echo is so perfect for Cesare. Loving every second of this stuff.", "Waited MONTHS for almost 4 min of this and as always it was completely worth it \ufe0f", "I have been absolutely obsessed with this episode since it came out, good lord this is some of the most out of nowhere shenanigans I've ever seen.", "Gotta give Cesare credit, he sure did vanish with no traces.", "I love how this episode implies Cesare is some kind of undead clown hunter, backed by the power of hell itself.", "\"A little gift from upper management\" \"I don't normally need any help catching you freakazoids\" ...Is Cesare... a clown hunter? \nMaybe under some larger Halloween-monster secret society, continuing a rivalry that was clearly established in Wire", "Man, I CANNOT WAIT for Worthi to release the full version of the song that plays at 2:33. That\u2019s another instant banger right there.", "Tim's world is crumbling around him rn. That lunch box is the only thing that has made him feel passion since he decided not to fight that elk, and it wasn't even a real lunchbox", "I\u2019m so glad you are making these, nobody could do it like you man. \ufe0f", "The art style!!! It gets better with each episode! Thank you for your hard work!  Worthikids is worth the wait lol", "It\u2019s like 6 regular people getting caught in some wild competition between 2 demigods.

And it is as beautiful as I could ever imagine\u2026", "You're one of the most talented animators on the platform god damn that was stylish", "The animation in this is amazing. The way you animated the crews reaction to Steve getting hit with the hammer is so smooth and satisfying. You are my absolute favorite animator on youtube!", "The moument when the music stops and then comes back with vocals in full swing goes so hard", "I must have more of this show, my god. I need an entire thirty min episode of this.", "I like how cesare is some sort of entity hunter playing as a food truck vendor to catch his next victim but also in the last episode he was genuinely invested in the burger science panel", "dude youre killing it with these, this specific brand of humor is just chef kiss ", "Clever immobilization tactic, since Steve can run as fast as a food truck on a highway. Cesare is quite the military tactical genius.", "I like how based on this shows world clowns are superior beings. I'm absolutely loving the progression of this show please make more no matter how long it takes. I can't wait to show my kids one of these days", "Chris Fleming could narrate the back of a cereal box and I'd be entertained by his abilite to emote a character.
