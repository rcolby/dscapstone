        "funny, 'cos it's true good stuff, Jo!",
        "I love Christmas. There's just something about the feel of the Winter holiday that hits different. It probably has to do with my childhood and my Mom. The little rituals we had that carried on through the years and gave it a unique feel. Hot chocolate after shoveling the driveway, skin prickling as it warmed near the heat of the fire, or the heater vent any time we didn't have a fireplace. Opening a single present on Christmas Eve, at least on years we could afford them.  The list of movies Mom insisted we had to watch because of 'tradition'.",

I think of the year as divided into eight sections based on the seasons. There is a special day to mark the beginning of each section. Halloween and Christmas are both such days. I would like to make it rule that each special days has to be hyped up after the previous one. I have seen Christmas stuff hyped in stores before Halloween. That is way too early. It isn't fair for Halloween. We should wait after Halloween until we do Christmas. There is Thanksgiving in between, but I am not worried about that. I have seen Halloween have the same problem as Christmas. September 21 is a special seasonal day, even if it isn't celebrated by the mainstream. There are times when Halloween is hyped up before that time. I still think it is too early.",
