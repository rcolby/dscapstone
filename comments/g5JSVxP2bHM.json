I almost felt a euphoric high from the chip. But the mouth pain went away after like 30 minutes. The worst part when it first hit my stomach. It was the worst pain of my entire life. It lasted maybe an hour and a half. Either he\u2019s leaving that part out. Or\u2026 hes just a tank.", "I want to thank you for not changing at all I love your authenticity plus your always happy in your videos. You and a couple other big time eaters I watch are the inspiration to go try food challenges with my friends when I get to a place in life to enjoy life", "I still remember how the jello bowl challenge went, lol.

You\u2019re a lot stronger than I am.", "I\u2019ve done this challenge the past three years, I love spicy stuff and make my own hot sauce with peppers i grow. Last summer I grew reapers and peach scorpions. I can deal with the mouth part, but always with the chip about an hour later stomach pains hit me, and I know it\u2019s supposed to be part of it. It\u2019s the gut punch, right on the box lol. It sucks. Idk how in the world the guy from hot dang show ate 61 one of these but he did.
