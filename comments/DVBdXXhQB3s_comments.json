        "Ray Crook",
        "Great job, Nick. I thoroughly enjoyed The Founder and how it told the McDonald's story. I realize you don't usually cover this in your presentation, but the casting in this movie was, in my opinion, the aspect that pushed it over the top. Thanks for all you do...",
        "Listen\u2026I grew up in San Diego and absolutely love the Padres.  I am grateful for him rescuing the Pads\u2026but he was a despicable person and a liar.  I have to admit that when the McDonalds opened in my town I interviewed with the.  Turns out I wasn\u2019t McDonald\u2019s material.  Not that I\u2019m bitter\u2026",
        "He is Not the Real McDonald's franchise he stole the recipe from the Real McDonald's brothers and they went to court saw the Movie ",
        "So glad to see a new one! I do prefer the older kind of videos (and especially theme music) but you're not one who's so departed from what I came for that I want to leave yet.",
        "Funny enough out of country McDonald's don't have exactly the same standards as American McDonald's, for instance some McDonald's in Europe gave you the option of having a gluten free bun for people with sceleack disease. Surprisingly enough the bun was actually good.",
        "Watching this film I was thinking how the Ferengi, uber-capitalist aliens from Star Trek, would love it.",
        "I was just about to go and watch this movie and low and behold, history buffs!",
        "Having wrkd at a McDonald's for over 4yrs I can say Crocks touch is very much alive. Built into the culture of McDonald's",
        "Omg, love it when you post your videos. Always a pleasant suprize",
        "happy to have another video, and so soon. It'll take me a while to get used to the new theme music though XD",
        "review Munich",
        "Ray Kroc's wife was not Jo Anne. It was Joan, and she was a huge public figure in San Diego after Ray's death, particularly because of her philanthropy. C'mon man, I expect better research from you. Get the names right!",
        "Even with him being an incredible monster, not wanting your x wife to be involved in the company he was and will be a part of indefinitely. He gave things like hard assets with real value and by giving her the house, allowed her to not be uprooted. This is not at all \u201cmorally dubious\u201d. Only in The last 50 years, and in the Western Hemisphere could a man say \u201cI earned all this money, and it has allowed you to live very very comfortably. That is a perk of being married to someone constantly working. I understand you don\u2019t like this, and would like to divorce. Essentially you are saying you like the money but hate how much I have to work to get it. Id like to make sure you are comfortable so you keep the house I bought, the car I bought, retirement package\u2026etc etc.Since you are leaving me I assume you will be seeking someone very different than me, so you can be happy.\u201d",
        "great episode as usual. thank you.",
        "Can we please get the pacific please, you already did Band of Brothers and the pacific has some amazing storylines to follow including John Basilone.",
        "Leasing the land sucks so bad for the consumer, so many remodels that make the restaurant uglier! Franchisee owners should have more power. My McDonalds only has one set of public doors now!",
        "The best way to describe Ray Kroc, pure effing hubris.",
        "Another great video Nick, but question: Who are these \"McDonalds\" brothers you keep referring to? Are they somehow  related to the McDonald brothers you briefly mentioned at the beginning of the video?",
        "The McDonald brothers founded the McDonald's restaurant and the McDonald's franchise.\nRay Kroc founded the McDonald's real estate.",
        "We missed you, Nick!\nAlways a good day when you release a new video.",

        "Please please please a video on Oliver Stone\u2019s JFK! That would be incredible!",
        "Thanks Nick... Keepem coming",
        "Excellent entry, as always.",
        "As someone who was raised off baseline, I do have an immense pride for San Bernardino and San Bernardino county. It's crazy, the origins of Mcdonald's and Taco Bell are in San Bernardino and both franchises became what they are today by essentially appropriating hard-working SB restaurants; in Taco Bell's case a restaurant called Mitla Cafe that's still open. Even though Dino is a dump I'm glad my city/county is getting some love and recognition",
        "Dick Mac sounds about right",
        "A point you didn't bring up but I love (I believe it's both in the movie and has been corroborated in real life): who Kroc franchised to. It's true, he started by getting some of his wealthy friends to open their own McDonald's, but those locations did suffer. The franchisees were in it to sit back and make money, nothing more and the quality suffered because of that. So what did he do? Instead of franchising to rich yuppies who couldn't give a rats ass if the location flourished or not and could move on to their next project, he franchised to middle class people. Blue collar people. People who didn't have a ton of money who could care about their restaurants because they were their babies.",
        "The recent make of All Quite on the Western Front on Netflix was amazing and bleak and might be worth looking at for your next piece. There are some inaccuracies that some have pointed out, but it doesn't take away from the experience.",
        "Great as always,i actualy only came across the movie afew months ago and watched it for the first time.",
        "I really would have loved to try them fast food burgers that the two brothers engineered before it became a franchise.",
        "I\u2019m so hyped History Buffs",

        "Didnt ray get rid of that speedy system?",
        "Thumbs up",
        "I had to do a paper on this movie once. My favorite part has always been Ray Croc in his car, staring menacingly at a McDonald's from afar like a stalker.",
        "Ray Crock was a crook.",
        "awesome vid like always but I like the old intro. bring it back.",
        "DO 13 hours",
        "Glad to see this movie getting a review. It\u2019s a pretty good movie",
        "I have a suggestion...\n'Into The Wild'?",
        "It's interesting you bring up the meaning behind the title, because it was originally titled FOUNDER, not THE FOUNDER.  And the reason for this original title was that it was also supposed to represent the idea of a ship or some large object \"foundering,\" as in unsteady, and ready to tip over.  I don't know why they switch the name.  Maybe that original idea was too cerebral and confusing.",
        "YouTube: History buffs posted 23hrs ago..\nMe: HOLY FUCKING SHIT!!!!!!!\nHOLY FUCKING SHIT!!!!!!! HOLY FUCKING SHIT!!!!!!! HOLY FUCKING SHIT!!!!!!!",
        "Inconsistent quality is the biggest problem with McDonald\u2019s for the past twenty years. Visiting one in Canada or Hawaii will ruin you for the ones back home. The quality is night and day.",
        "I\u2019m from San Bernardino, it went very down hill. A lot of gang violence and drug/homeless problems",
        "I have missed your videos Nick! Love your show!",
        "Nick have you heard of The Spy with Sacha Baron Cohen I think you'll like it upon doing research",
        "I assume that the first burgers was better. I feel like most hamburgers I eat at MacDonald's today make me a little sick consistently.",
        "Sad to see the McDonald's brothers cheated out of their money by Ray, they could have hired a better lawyer or a hitman to take him out. When you give someone your word and a handshake and then don't follow thru that shows what a sorry human being you are. Lost all my respect for the Croc's.",
        "HISTORY BUFFS IS BACK!",
        "The Fouader?",
        "Yaaaay",
        "Would love for you to review the movie Nuremberg(2000) to see how quickly how annoyed you will be with the inaccuracies",
        "People forget that Kroc saw Californians as wanting customization and therefore an inconsistent menu would happen. But by opening the Midwest, you get employees from a culture that does not like to rock the boat. And he even said so. Illinois also had Route 66 and was a popular gateway when the US Highway System built that took people out west.",
        "I was born in San Bernardino. One of the oldest Restaurants of McDonald's is still standing even though not operational. Just there for the sight.",

        "History Buff should do 'one video one topic'\nOr it gets less interesting with each video.",
        "I've always thought that movie was a bit underappreciated, Keaton did great in it and it was very informative even if there were some minor inaccuracies.",
        "And now, most of the new McDonald\u2019s are being built with the original design elements back in, with the neon arches on either side of the building. And a lot of of the old ones are getting remodeled.",
        "Having worked in a middling status fast food restaurant I'm mortally terrified of what it would be like to work in a fully engaged one. Those procedures we never followed... all in place. Gross.\nThe average one of these places runs entirely differently, 3 to 5 fewer staff, hopping around doing other people's jobs when it's useful, odd tasks that need to be completed. ",

        "McDonald's is the nastiest fast \"food\" on the planet. Why people still eat it is beyond me. My guess is population control. \n\nIt was decent before the 2000's, then the food quality was abysmal. Ick.",
        "Can we focus on history that's not so related to reconstituted human waste in burger form please?",
        "Your back you ledge",
        "Fun fact: my old boss in Detroit had a father who he was 100% sure was in the mafia. His mob dad BOUGHT one of these first ever McDonald's. His wife told him, \"Americans will always eat hotdogs over hamburgers.\" He sold it, and regularly reminded her that it was her idea.",

        "It seemed to gloss over the fact Kroc had exponentially more financial resources the brothers did. Knowing a CEO of Tasty Freeze  for one ... I'm sure the \" country club \" guys had names too.\nMore a\" rich taking from hard working folks and getting richer\" story, than a \"pulled up by boot straps\" story.",

        "OMG its a video that isnt about Narcos! Fuck ya!",
        "I am still hoping that you'll consider doing a video on Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas , as despite its oddball exterior, both HST's book and Gilliam's film make for a solid period piece about the 1970s counter-culture - both its joys and its ills - and how it contrasted with Las Vegas' mix of Hollywood Glamour and Middle American wish fulfillment.",
        "My god he was an awful man who had an eye for business. Kroc looks and thinks like a croc",

In 1930, with whatever money they had scraped together, they purchased a 750-seat movie theater 20 miles outside Los Angeles in Glendora, calling it the Beacon Theatre. But this being the Great Depression, it did poorly. They noticed that kids seemed to always have enough money for food like burgers and soda. So with a $5,000 loan, the McDonald brothers started the Airdrome hot dog stand in 1937 by an airfield in Monrovia, calling it The Airdome, and they targeted spectators who were watching the planes. This was a success, but they predicted that in the future, they'd need to appeal to cars. So they moved to San Bernardino, changed the name to McDonald's, and the rest is history.",

LA is an ocean of concrete and Atlanta is a forest. I don't know if this is laziness or what, but holy shit. They don't even try to approximate the asthetic of individual locations. I can sorta understand the assumption that nobody knows or cares what San Bernardino looks like (I don't blame them) but LA? that is arguably the most photographed and filmed city on earth, even somebody from Timbuktu could pick it out of a line up.

I totally see Kroc as a power-hungry egomaniac who always wanted more money and power. Also, I believe that there was a handshake agreement, and he simply scammed them in the end on that part. One thing to understand - Kroc didn't have that kind of money, and it was thanks to Sonneborn who found investors (that's where the whole problem of the investor's opinion was found). But when you think about it, they got a million each in the end (after taxes), which after taxation in current days would be around 8 million dollars, which is not chump change. Furthermore, their FIRST McDonald's (not in Des Plaines...) was successful. You also have to take into account their income from franchises. So not bad for retairment plan. Yes, they came up with the concept of their restaurant and also the golden arches, and that is important! But Croc was the one who created this large franchise of restaurants in so many countries and then later all over the world. Also, he created a concept where he could maintain quality in (almost) every restaurant\u2014that awesome university... When you think about these two brothers, who basically wanted to retire in peace, they didn't get the worst deal.

        "Good to see this. I enjoyed the movie and was always curious about how accurate it was. The movie seems to have been made with the approval and support of the Corporation. It initially comes across as a promotional film, although it takes a harder turn in the later stages when it addresses the disagreements.",

        "My father, Carl Eriksen, was Ray Kroc's personal assistant from 1966 to 1970. He is briefly mentioned in Kroc's book. I knew Ray Kroc and his wife Jane. (there was a short-lived experiment called \"Jane Dobbin's Pie Restaurant\") I was around when Ray divorced her for Joan (not Joanne as you say in this video). In 1970, my parents and I went to Hamburger University in Elk Grove, Illinois (west of Chicago). I was the youngest graduate at age 14! I still have the diploma. Kroc was supposed to help my parents start up their own franchise but somehow that deal did not materialize. I can personally vouch for the portrayal of Kroc in the film. He was a ruthless and angry man with a huge ego. When he bought the San Diego Padres baseball team, he got into trouble with the Commissioner of Baseball because he used the PA system to apologize to the fans for his team's poor performance in 1977. He was a control freak and everything had to go his way. He would often visit a McDonald's in his Rolls Royce and if there was trash in the parking lot he would personally pick it up and then berate the manager.",
