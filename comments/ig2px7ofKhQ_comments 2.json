        "The very fact that they are now using a proprietary connector is sounding the alarms in my head, sorry! Not going to support that! In fact I am GLAD and THANKFUL that the EU is forcing even Apple to use USB-C and now Nvidia tries this crap? Sorry, but go to hell! Stuck with you for over a decade (had my last AMD-Card in 2007 or so!), but this is too far - especially in addition to your unfair pricing! Seriously, I'll wait for the new AMD-GPUs and buy one of them!",
        "A close colleague of mine has done failure analysis in electronics for decades, and he had this to say when I asked him how accurate this breakdown was:\n\n> Pretty legit, a lot of that hits very close to home, especially the high pressure, long testing times and \u201cwild theories\u201d. Tin plated connectors can be easily screwed up, especially since they shouldn\u2019t be use for more than 5 insertion cycles. Some plating shops are also super shady! ",
        "You did draw 600 Watts though this connector? 50 A through this small connector. Holy cow. \n\nWell why they didn't use some kind of connector similar to what VGA cables had in the past? You tighten it and it's fixed. Or something like display ports have. Something that clicks in on the sides and prevent the connector from bending and twisting as you tested. I am afraid that even fully pressed in connector may suffer some melting...",
        "Scientific methods to find the reasons for a serious issue! Don't have that card or any interest in buying, but I just want to support a content creator that can be trusted!",
        "There is no A on the Nvidia Logo. You must mean the A on the Nvidia NAME.",
        "I never planned on getting an RTX 4090, nothing I play is that graphically intense, but seeing your coverage on this probably the best I've seen on any tech product. Most only seem to repeat what others have said but you've gone the extra mile and ran actual tests on these claims. I hope you guys are part of a new trend on consumer reporting.",
        "Imagine how much better off the world would be if areas such as politics, corporations, and other shady entities had this level of credible, detailed journalistic investigation.\n\nUnfortunately for my pipe dream you guys have found great success in the PC sector. Feels like one million subs wasn't so long ago, and pieces like this are why you're creeping on two million so quickly. Awesome work. Glad this community has you guys.",
        "Im like only a few handful seconds in and there's already mention of a failure analysis lab and omg. Whatever hope the company had about refuting whatever you are about to say... poooof!",
        "buying 4090 come with rng of you burning your house",
        "The HAL 9000 series is foolproof and incapable of error!",
        "Having a high-resistance path will NEVER cause overheating. Electricity takes the path of least resistance. What will cause overheating is a lack of paths of low resistance. So more likely the cause of this is the fact those nubs are being angled, so instead of flat contact they have point contact.\nWe really have no one to blame but bad DIYers on this one. Pulling on a plug to make sure it's seated fully is assembly 101.",
        "So... \nBad connector design that doesn't click into place + card is too wide and long to fit in many cases properly + terrible socket placement (the outward edge of the card) forcing users to bend their cable to clear side panels + no detection circuit to prevent this = uSeR eRrOr hurr dur!",
        "Surely they will be forced to recall them all because it's a fire hazard.\n\nIt seems like the 6 pin socket design is no longer fit for purpose with the power draw of some cards. It needs replacing with something more robust.",
        "Just to think AMD was thinking about going to this plug. Thank GOD they didn't.  Nvidia needs to take notes and take things back to R&D.",
        "Keep up the amazing work!",
        "6:55 imho, at that point is not user error, but design error. If you designed the connector such as being easy to improperly connect and that improper connection makes it either a fire, or a shock hazard, you should not be designing said connector in the first place.",
        "What it means to me?  Absolutely nothing.  I won't be able to afford a 4090 until the 7090's come out.",
        "My God the level of detail and scrutiny in GN videos never ceases to impress me. This is a whole \u2018nother level. Most youtubers would just blurt out whatever the latest news is and get clicks for that, not GN, they go the whole way!",
        "I know that hating on Nvidia is the thing now, but come on, if you can afford to buy a 4090 and not be able to plug it in properly...",
        "Incredible work as always! It's hard to make a 30 minute informative piece also be highly engaging to watch, but you have done it yet again. This should help viewers remember everything that much better, and be more critical and attentive when it comes to other reports (which will hopefully help dampen sensational reporting going forwards).",

        "Appreciate the insightful content about the connector. Thanks to Steve and the entire GN Team for speaking out on this issue on NVIDIA Behalf.",

        "All I hear is Gamers Nexus taking nVidia's money to damage control.",
        "awesome work! i'm a design and release engineer in the auto industry. quick connect cables like these should have an audible click sound when fully seated, and should have a low insertion force. no guess work should be needed by the customer to verify the cable is fully seated",
        "One nitpick: I'd say that a 0.1% failure rate is actually quite high for a dangerous failure mode like this - that means 1 in 1000 units fail dangerously! At that rate, I'd be inclined to suspect that the design just doesn't have enough of a safety margin (against eg. aforementioned user error).",
        "Excellent work! I don't think you should include the particle theory, by your own words it wasn't replicated, so it falls in the same bag as Igor's lab.",
        "Thank you for this informative video and well put together.\n\nYour team and you deserve so much respect for this amazing effort that has put in this video, all your videos are worth donating to.",

        "Turned into a good life lesson ",
        "Loose connections really do cause melted cables - it happened with the 4 pin CPU connector on my previous PC. About a year after I built it, one day I noticed that it wouldn't start up at all, but then it started after I unplugged the 4 pin connector and inserted it more firmly. I thought it was just a fluke and didn't think anything of it, but then several years later my PSU's 4 pin cable melted, then the second one also melted after I switched to the power supply's second 4-pin cable. ",
        "nvdia owes you money",
        "Thanks! That is exactly what I wanted to know. Any chance you can share the name/contact info for the failure analysis lab you used?",
        "Pound for Pound for the price, performance AMD gpu's are superior over Nvidia ridiculous expensive prices.  Also the technology that AMD uses for lower power supply watts will save us money.",
        "Anyway the socket is bad. There are many reliable high current sockets existing on the market. Nvidia just choosed cheap trash instead of proper solution",
        "everyone knows bubbly melting plastic boosts performance all the way up to 451 fps",
        "Great video and analysis. This kind of information should've come from the manufacturer.",
        "So basicly best way to avoid this thing is to route all your cables finish everything,put it on table connect everything at back side and last connect the connector to gpu realy good put or dont put side panel and you fine?maybe even some how ziptie the plug  guess im lucky i cant afford one ",
        "So, we can move on to the next horse to beat dead?",
        "Thank you for the great reporting. I don't have a 4090 but I do have an NZXT H1, and your thorough reporting on these types of issues is incredibly important.\n\n\n\nMany automotive connectors have double locks. where the secondary lock will not engage if the cable is not completely seated. That design ensures that it is obvious to the person assembling the device if they have connected the cable correctly. For a connector that passes 60+ amps, I think it would be wise for Nvidia to design a connector that provides positive feedback regarding proper insertion.",
        "Next up in the news: Nvidia let's go all their testing and safety engineers, GN will do that work for them in the future. I really don't understand how a YouTube channel can find the resources to do a root cause analysis of a failure like this and a mega corp like Nvidia seems to just shrug their shoulders and let the issue slide.",
        "This is basically free R&D for nvidia damn",
        "Very well done and I applaud your level of quality. The extra effort you did to involve xrays from an external company that specializes in failure analysis really shows how much you care about accurate reporting.  I thank you and the many people make supporting you, making these larger expenses.",
        "I wonder if it would help fix it to have the connector clip on both sides instead of a center latch.",
        "Cool, but im still going team red this gen. :D",
        "Thank you for going back to facts. You had a few videos that were very biased, while you claimed you are unbiased, and you hurt those people.\nWords from people never tells a story, only evidence tells the full story. This proves this, yet you tore down other youtubers because of what you heard online. Again, thank you for getting to the facts.",
        "Incredible content! Your commitment to finding the actual root cause here is truly commendable.",
        "It's hardly fair to expect a small company like Nvidia to research and test at the level of Gamers Nexus though.\nIncidentally, why would you ever have such a high current connector, sounds like politics, they could easily have gone for more pins. Why not 16? They wanted to downplay the power... looks like that went well.",
        "Great work and great video. It makes me wonder if NVIDIA and the like took the time to employ your methods and a lab.  You would think that they would have the biggest need for knowing what is happening. I'm pretty sure they have more resources and money to invest in this research and testing. Anyway, I'm glad you are here doing the work that needs done!",
        "Responsible reporting and the lack of it is why people have lower trust in \"mainstream\" journalism than the US Government.\n\nThank you for doing it right.",
        "Hurray for the scientific method. Great job.",
        "Phenomenal video, and as always, I learned something new. Thanks to you and your entire team Steve! ",
        "To think these guys were once working out of a house doing mostly CPU and GPU benchmarks. It's impressive to see how far you guys have come since then! Thank you for going out of your way to provide this much valuable information for the PC-building community.",
        "It's at this point that my occupational therapist telling me that she was greatly surprises at how strong my grip was/is during my carpal tunnel rehab. Apparently, there is (and has been for quite some time) a national epidemic of \"weak grip\"/lack of hand strength.",

For a team that prides itself on meticulous technical data it pains me to hear Steve mangle the use of the words \u201ctheory\u201d and \u201cfact\u201d and do so with such confident gusto.\n\nA fact is what something IS. A hypothesis is a guess as to the WHY. A theory is the hypothesis that is widely accepted as the best WHY based on repeated experiments yet it is still subject to change if a better hypothesis comes along that can be validated.",
        "4090 1, dummies 0. I was getting fed up with people saying I was stupid to use mine.

I ran it for about an hour before I checked my adapter cables and heard a clicking from the connector. Gave one hard push and it made a loud click and it was in. I've been building PCs for almost 27 years and still made this mistake. Couldn't tell you how far out my adapter was but I assumed it was in given the amount of force I applied and know it wasn't given the loud click of the latch connecting when I gave that last push.",

        "okay, i'm tired. Simple solution to the complicated problem. Use clipping mechanism that presses contacts from both - up and down. like putting hand in the waffle maker - metal contact from above and metal contact from below the pins that clamp onto pin.

        "clearly, you did more testing on these cables than Nvidia\u2019s QA department ",
        "Very thorough analysis. Well done!\nNVIDIA really didn't do themselves a favor with this connector. There was no necessity for it to be this small but their over-engineered tiny PCBs. They could have just gone with the standard tried-and-trusted PCIe connectors.",
        "It seems that EVGA knew something the rest didnt until now. the 4090 is a disaster of a launch and i think they knew so they got out.",
        "Wow, truly informative and extremely thorough!",
        "To think someone would call you a Nvidia apologist is nuts to me.\n\nI think it's fair to say that this is primarily a problem of user error induced from a design that makes it a bit to easy to screw up. Cable management usually puts strain on cables, people don't want to put too much force onto a connector, the lack of satisfying click means people might not notice when the cable is seated, and people work on their machines more than once. Ultimately not accounting for user error is itself a design fault. Had they, somewhat ironically, made the connection looser but easier to know when attached properly there probably would be less failures. I believe that if you have a clip it doesn't also need to be a press fit like Molex and trying to design it to work without the clip makes it more prone to failure rather than less.",

Tthey're wrong more often than they're right. And you go the extra mile to reproduce the failures like the NZXT riser card fires, exploding Gigabyte power supplies, now the melting 12V GPU connectors. You put in the effort to get x-rays, to get resin sections, to analyze the failures under a microscope, and finally put together a theory that is both correct and that you could reproduce.

Really sad Nvidia has been so good reliable, fast, stable GPU's with monthly driver updates. The rtx 3080 has the old-style connectors doesn't suck down a ton of power either. Why NVidia? I thought you had labs and testers to double check before launching a product? How/why did this happen? was the 40 series rushed? who's responsible for this? I demand answers from an official Nvidia representative. The community at large all the pc gamers/content creators need to step up and put Nvidia on notice. This could be a serious health hazard. It needs to be resolved before any GPUs from NVidia are purchased or sold. AMD has two 8 pin connectors on their RDNA 3 that's what I'm buying.",

You shouldn't apologize for the timeline because thorough and ACCURATE research demands time and cannot be rushed. I don't own or plan to buy a 4090 now or in the future, but the lessons learned from this situation can be applied to all computer hardware (not just GPUs).

There are multiple mentions of a high resistance parallel path as a potential cause of heating, however that makes no sense. Electricity makes heat (mainly) by the Joule effect which has the formula I\u00b2R. This means that current is way more important to cause heating than resistance. By adding a high resistance in parallel to the low resistance connector, the total resistance will be about the same (actually a little lower than before) which means the voltage drop across the connector will be about the same (also a little lower in reality). Ohms law states U=IR. So if voltage U across the connector and the high resistance parallel path stays the same, that means current I halves every time you double R in the parallel path. Applying the Joule effect I\u00b2R, this mean that for each doubling of R, the amount of heating in that parallel path halves.",

Though now I don't think it is the reason for the melting pins like I did at first, it seems like an added point of of failure. What I mean is that if one of those pins breaks off from that metal plate, wouldn't that push the remaining wires well beyond their capacity and cause damage around that area? Because there is no way for the gpu/psu to know that one of those wires broke off, it will still ask for/send up to 600 watts through the remaining wires and (if I understand this correctly as a noob) overheat them with that much power being forced down the wires. Pin-to-pin cables do have this problem if the wires break, but in theory should be far less prone to it since they are without that metal plate. ",

        "Okay I do electrical work and have seen many high voltage issues in joints/connectors. Things change a lot. My biggest question is does the cable only burn on that one end ever? If so there is probably many ways to fix that connection and lower its resistance. That\u2019s the big problem looks to me along with arching. So fix those two things with just a couple easy hacks I can think of and every single one would be fine. But if I didn\u2019t fix the issues before and during connection I would not trust it. It\u2019s getting like appliances lol where the wire inside is so crap but they get away with it low gauge and many joints of low quality. Problem is not everyone is going to understand this that works in computers because y\u2019all are just now starting to see any kind of voltage and ohh lol are y\u2019all gonna learn lol. Only if everything could be a clean 110-130v at 50-60hz. For that we gotta pay gotta take dirty power change to DC and back to AC all with losses. Why tho? For it all to be able to use highest voltage where possible and there is proper way to insulate circuits and still handle heat. There\u2019s a reason high voltage is used to go long distances but also a reason you don\u2019t see it near as close to other circuits or grounds either tho. It\u2019s also a way to use smaller wire at higher amps. Joints and connectors can be important tho after voltage goes up for many reasons. Also traces at higher voltages my god the distance they could arch if not properly insulated and all. It\u2019s a lot different but I can\u2019t believe they can\u2019t even get 12v right tho lol. Problem is it\u2019s 12v tho just go even higher lol. I\u2019m no electrical engineer but I build a lot of toys and fix everybody products just about lol that\u2019s if I can. But I have been so electrician many years so I get this quick and seems obvious too me. I\u2019m joking about higher voltage BTW at least for now lol that\u2019s another day and year. But everything within the connection bust be beefed up to lower resistance. Too much material bad too little bad and wrong materials used is what is causing this. It should be able to be partially connected and not heat like that especially at that specific point what about any other end of the cable? It\u2019s nonsense so stupid of an overlook I just don\u2019t get it. I guess some just never dealt with real amperage and ever had to learn about resistance in connections. That\u2019s why we electrical guys real ones love to hardwire and some of us in certain situations even solder thing tin things we get a little more involved than the average electrician. Over the years tho we learn to tell a lot by feel. Also we use meters lol but still this is so so stupid never should be an issue stop allowing companies to use such small gauge wires at end points and just enough. Obviously sometimes you can get it wrong a little therefor leave plenty of overhead. That\u2019s the issue why is it not bigger than needed of shoulda doubled the volts by now until you get to traces and things so close. I get the whole issue with arch and all but I can see places where voltage changes multiple times can be very beneficial but for carrying certain amps it\u2019s almost a must and then what? Can we insulate things enough to keep them close at higher voltages? We will see which way all this goes has me really curious after they couldn\u2019t handle ever 12v lol. I can\u2019t wait to see the future to there so much to come soon.",
        "Thank you! Amazing content, highly professional! Love you channel! I think you guys are top tier tech channel",
        "Thank you for covering this properly. There's so much information being presented as fact that I was very deceived by all this mess. It's really hard to check sources on this issue right now.  It's also been really interesting that no one was able to reliabky recreate the failure until now.",
        "One thing to note. Im supprised that cutting down to 2 pins didnt cause a thermal issue. Yet a fully connected plug could fail on one pin.\nAs you noted, the power + resistance causes heat... Yet. power also prefers the path of least resistance. Meaning that if each pin is equal and one is not. The equal pins should take on a higher load than the failing pin. As the power prefers the least resistance... So in theory even with 1 bad pin the power should balance out. Which suggests theres something really funky going on on the receiving side. Maybe the card favours certain pins over others?",
        "Just want to say excellent job guys.  Real quality engineering going on here (used to be a QE myself). In most scenarios, this type of \"deep dive\", \"FMEA\" does not occur until insurance companies and government agencies get involved, after people experience injury and lawsuits are afoot.  No sir, not here in the Gaming PC world.  ",
        "Nice reporting! This is a pretty valuable service to the consumer space, bringing clarity as to what not to do, but also being clear and accurate on fault and mitigation.",
        "It is a stupid connector, solving a problem that didn't exist.",
        "Good science takes time, open minds, collaborative expertise, and sophisticated  - and often expensive - testing.  Steve and the team at GN are exemplary scientists!  The \"Ted Talk\" was very necessary and appreciated.  I hope other content creators will learn something.  I just ordered my debug coasters to complete my collection and to make a tiny dent in the expensive testing that went into this most excellent video.",
        "Incredible work. Have barely read 10 resposnes so I'm sure it's been said though it's highly likely that the lack of positive confirmation of connection by the plug clicking into place leads to the connector working its way out of the socket over time. Particularly if there is directional physical strain on the cable in any direction. I've similar failures before on 6 and 8 pin pcie connectors at both GPU and power supply end of the cable and put it down to cramped conditions and my own laziness for not ensure the plug is properly seated. Pretty sure I had a molex connector melt once too (yes I'm old) though that was just overly ambitious current draw.",
        "Excellent work!! PCI SIG needs to go back to the drawing board on this one.  Just too much power flowing through such a small surface area.  The design is (apparently) difficult for end users to use safely.  Power connectors should be idiot proof.  Especially when carrying this much power.",
        "Sorry but like the technician I am I know why this connector is failing all the time, imagine a video card demanding 10-20 amperes and going through a finest pin and terminals the most fragile or the first poor connection will overheating and finally be burned... Electrical physics my brothers, and I don't know what's going on on the technical department from nvidia",
        "Finally, someone scientifically gets it right by actual testing and not by guessing(theorizing). Good job Steve and all the crew at Gamers Nexus.",
        "watch were air flow comes off fan if look you see hot air hitting side pins so when card starting getting up temp hotter pins get they build box around pins or chance way air flow so air don't go near pins it poor design of cooling fins. have look around pin area watch heat go up as card starts get hotter u see. why don't you make a out of box design with pins and connector find way draw same power as video card find if just pins and connector my be over heating or design of cooling system.",
        "Never paid any money on YouTube before, but this was such insanely good work I couldn't not. You guys are the best.",
        "hopefully nvidia pays you for doing their r&d for them :P",
        "Eh! Just install it in an NZXT H1 with an exploding Gigabyte PSU. It'll be fine.",
        "Nvidia should be paying you MILLIONS! You saved them so much money in testing and engineering costs. While also probably causing millions in loss over deserved negative press ;) Hats off to everyone at Gamers Nexus. What an amazing journey to witness as you and your team have become the gold standard of tech news, hardware review and most impressively, enterprise level testing and evaluation.",
        "RGB Fan for Powercables: when?",
        "Nvidia thanks you for doing their job for them.",
        "The work you're doing here is gonna make a big difference!",
        "\"JUST PLUG IT BETTER \" lol it s like the \" hold the iphone in the correct way\"",
        "Anything designed to carry significant current and be operated non-professionals should have some sort of safety system to prevent this (sense pins, shortening pins required for operation that dont carry current, etc)",
        "The solution on this problem is siple. The manufatures just need to separate the power conector on 2 x 8 pin like before and this problem will be fix. Now there a to many pins in one conector wich is a too close together wich made a lot of heat.",
        "When a youtube channel do more engineering work than the producer (Nvidia) itself.",
        "Looks like a Dodge Dakota blower resistor. Air gap = carbon with each startup and soon enough you're carbon arcing between pins.",
        "I bought merchandise from GN because of Steve's last video on this ... beating Nvidia to the punch on their own stuff.  Though I returned my 4090 to Newegg already, I'll feel better about a potential future 40-series purchase.  Thanks Steve!",
        "Great thanks to the Failure Analysis LAB. Excellent work and awesome gathering of data and information and reporting from GN!!!",
        "Nvidia needs to slow down, they're really turning into the bad guys pretty fast. Been an Nvidia buyer my entire life, on the verge of buying an AMD next upgrade, doesn't feel right buying from Nvidia.",
        "Nvidia should just integrate the dyson sphere required to power a 4090 into the gpu so you dont need a power cable",
        "Continually amazing content and amazing attention to detail! <3",
        "I have a 4090 gaming trio and the very first thing I made absolutely sure of was a complete and firm plugin on the adapter. I even double checked that the clip hooked onto the small plastic latch. I've opened and added parts to my PC several times since getting my 4090 as I'm adding more RGB shenanegans in there and once or twice I check if the cable is burned up. Fortunately there's no signs whatsoever that it is so while I do think this design is fundamentally weak and vulnerable to failure, and Nvidia/Intel should've done a lot better I also think there IS a way to do it right and safe so you can just enjoy your GPU without worry.",
        "I think you should publish this investigation. This is almost academia standard.",
        "This sounds like a lot just to plug a GPU in",
        "Without Steve/GN and other YTers getting big enough to afford tests like these, we would be stuck with whatever BS marketing we get from major companies telling us that everything is daijoubu. Thank you GN for investing your time, energy and finances into important topics that give us the truth of the situation.",
        "Thank you, GN.",
        "nVidia is really powerful. There is so much care about this theme in the professional circuits. That's the way it should be. But what if this fail were happening on AMD's cards?.\nHere there is a clear design mistake that should have been detected on internal lab tests, at least in the mid stages of the product's deveopment.",
        "With the adapter I pushed pretty hard and never got a click.  I got a click with the cablemod cable",
        "You guys really take everything much further than any other channel in terms of your reporting. Great work.",
        "can you not xray the cable whilst on  with not plugged in properly to show the arcing across the connection  to show why its heating up be good to see ?  , arcing across bad joint will cause heat quickly",
        "find it VERY HARD to believe there's hundreds of users unable to notice a cable that's half sticking out. there must be some other failure mode at play",
        "wow; great work",
        "The amount of testing on this video just proves why the RTX 4000 series is a big fail.",
        "Outstanding works sir, this is the depth of analysis we should be looking for when delving into burning issues (pun intended).  I feel like all 4090 and soon to be 4080 owners owe you a payment, not to mention nVidia themselves, whom I doubt did nearly as much as you guys other than waving the issue away as they always do in annoyance.",
        "incredible work",
        "Well, I guess it's time to update that \"GPU testing experience\" graph to \"out of the chart\" level",
        "I love how well you did this work. Very well done.",
        "I think that the failures related to foreign object debris are a manufacturer design flaw that allows for a gpu power socket to sit upright in an environment where metal shavings, old thermal paste, and who knows what could fall into the socket, helped along by a lot of moving air and system vibrations.",
        "This may be the most important channel for Pc analysis. I hope this sets a precedent to really know what you're paying for, and hopefully leads to a future where everyone can be informed on their tech.",
        "I have said this before, I'll say it again. I should not have to buy extra things to get a product to work properly",
        "Probably not healthy to breath in that stuff as it burns ",
        "Am I the only one that's been hearing the \"tinny\" audio issue in the left-channel of GN videos for the last month or so? It seems like it's just the audio coming from Steve's lav mic in videos at times but it might be something besides that. Actually it seems like all the audio in this video - but I don't hear it in other videos from other channels, just GN. The audio seems fine except with an extra layer of highest frequencies on it, only in the left-channel. When I play the audio back in audacity at half-speed it's like there's a really high frequency echo in the left channel, but it happens in the video all over the place, not just in one place where one person is talking, which leads me to think it's a recording hardware issue somehow.",
        "I can't express how valuable your unbiased, science-based approach is. I know you know how great your channel is and everyone here is very grateful for the effort in each of your videos. Thank you!",
        "The fact that the RTX 4090 draws 8,3 Amps from each one of the pins of the connector that are officially rated for 8,5 Amps is a shame. And I don't even talk about a GPU that would have been overclocked with MSi Afterburner for example. It's so close from the limit. No margin ? Who is stupid enough to forget about this ?",
        "Looks like he didn't plugged the connector all the way in.",
        "New Jimmy intro sounding even better than ever. Definitely my favorite =:-*",

        "Sorry tech jesus, but that conclusion is the most anti-consumer and pro-corpo I've ever seen from you.\n\nYour sample of 1 case of an \"extremely\" badly inserted adapter is no indicative of anything, here people have reported cases of melting with good insertion, click and everything.",
        "if the retaining clips were at the edges rather than the centre it would be easier to check if it was fully inserted and stop it being pulled at an angle.",
        "Excellent video as always.\n\nI can't tell you the number of times that I have purposely and deliberately burst into an emotionally charged discussion and FORCED it to become a data-driven, evidenced-based discussion instead and then watch all of those people who were so emotionally charged, fissle out of said discussion because they COULDN'T provide the data nor the evidence to back up their statements nor claims that they were making.",
        "I now want a thermal screen computer case.",
        "Imagine playing Super Hot.\n\nCurrent GPU temperature is...",
        "Thanks a lot for this! I work at an archviz company and we upgrading all our workstations to 4090's as well as most of our clients.\nMy team actually had sleepless nights over this, great to have it finally figured out.",
        "Why not just having locking pins like usb c, display port, and hdmi have?",
        "Not for nothing but knowing and working in the electronics field from car audio installation to micro soldering repair. Nvidia is taking 4, 8 pin high current PCIe connectors and adapting to a 12+4 high current power adapter that the wires are thinner and really cannot handle that kind of wattage. From its inception, it was a bad design and idea and bound to fail.",
        "This is the first time that I was ever felt compelled to make a donation to a content creator and deservedly so. Truly amazing work from Steve and the GN team! The community is so lucky to have you guys and this video proves that no one even comes close to the dedication that you guys have to straight up factual journalism and responsible reporting.",
        "Wow! Awesome job guys! The work y\u2019all put into researching issues is truly unmatched.",
        " Stop  buying  nvidia.",
        "As a 4090 owner, I really appreciate you looking into this matter. Your professionalism is impeccable and you really are at the forefront of technology journalism. Thank you for your hard work.",
        "Nvidia should reimburse you the costs of all this analysis. I bet their engineers will see this and use some of the findings in solution/upgrade/next gen.",

        "as a mechanical engineer student, im just loving with all my heart all of these testing results, jeez, this is amaaazing",
        "GN, you guys are awesome. \nThank you for all the hard work, looking for facts, and doing it correctly. Like old time journalists and reporters, not fast but thorough. <3",

        "We need 220 v uk connector",
        "I'm wondering if the problem is people trying to jam these massive cards into their existing cases (or new ones that aren't big enough) and then not having room for able management and/or are just trying to get the cables out of the way for airflow. Then things get pulled tight in the process and things heat up and melt.",
        "The saddest part of this WHOLE fiasco is that you guys have to do these tests at all! I'm sure \"some\" will agree that this should be Nvidia's job... right? Thanks for the great content yall. ",
        "I'm still taken aback at what a truly massive card the 4090 is.  It becomes even more obvious when seen out of a case like this.",
        "So basically this issue has potentially (under the conditions you mentioned) always existed for any connector but exacerbated by the high power usage?",
        "I find, the more pins a connector has the more annoying it is to plug in or out, like the mainboard 24 pin connectors being a pain. Just had to test a failed system with different PSUs and the force I had to apply to get these connectors properly clipped in and to remove them again was crazy...",
        "Test 3090Ti vs 4090,",
        "Love the hard work and dedication! I literally told a friend yesterday I was waiting to form my opinion on the cables until GN covered the topic. Well worth the wait!",
        "ust a follow up to my post about Newegg. They didn't answer my E mails about the matter. The card wasn't shipped from them in California as was listed but, by some third party seller in Georgia. And of course they lied about three day shipping. It's taking 6 business days. The only good news is that I bought through E Bay, so should have no problem with return. Definitely will avoid them in the future.",
