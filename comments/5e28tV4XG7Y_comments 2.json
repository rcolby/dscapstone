        "Disclaimer: This could be nothing at all but something that kinda caught my eye. In the video where the girls are at the food truck, at the part of the video when they draw on the red circle there is a guy with a white hoodie in the upper-middle part of the screen. He seems to stand by himself and looks like he's watching them. When the first girl moves away he's still standing there but when the second girl moves, he moves. Like I said, could be nothing but honestly everyone at that food truck is a potential suspect (as well as anyone who had access to their home) and he looked extra sus to me. That's what happens when you spend too much time watching the ID Channel.",

Walked passed the group with what appears to be a little nudge in the back of the girl in the white coat then  a brush against the bigger guy. When she passes back she walks directly through the group. The guy with the hat turned backwards shrugs. Don't know if they know each other.",
        "Everyone's asking how possibly those girls could have slept through this.  Well one .. was the four people awake when they were killed....    Two... If they were awake.  Have you lived ever lived in a girl's college house... Good lord there are nights you have no choice to learn to fall asleep to very loud and high pitched voices that would possibly be similar to what happened that night.

If it was the killer, at least thats part of the puzzle. Also who called, was it the roomates or someone else. I feel like the killer is right under their noses.",

Standing about 6-8 ft behind the girls, looking in their direction. Looked to me like he was by himself, didint seem to interact with anyone around in this short video. Did he order food? Im sure the investigators have identified people in the video, i hope. That guy seemed odd to me.",

She would let them all know she was banging me and had other guys around besides them to pit them against each other so they would do more stuff for her. She would make plans and then ghost them. They would show up and bang on her door for 45 min straight. Then they would see my car and say you\u2019re with Cadillac guy aren\u2019t you. Even though they were mad they would stick around and then they would buy her something to try and win her. This is how I always thought she would end up after messing with the wrong dudes emotions.",

And of course, they then needed to kill them being their own witnesses and make it as if some psycho killer did the job.  As for the two others, they had been drugged up in another part of the house, so no need to involve.  Or what may be even sicker, they participated in the orgy.  What else to do in a small town?   Something is creepy about these police who so confidentaly told all there was no danger (yeah, unless you are an attractive female who may be next target)!  I would not trust these cops, they seem to be covering up something, and don't want the public involved.  People of Moscow, get out while you can!",

I saw another video where he walks after them as they leave.  And in this video, which I did not see before, at 3:03 watch as Kaylee gets done paying.

The two roommates should be detained and grilled relentlessly because they know something.

The police came and then also walked inside the open door and found everyone else. It could have also been a group of students that did it together but that should be obvious to the coroner.
