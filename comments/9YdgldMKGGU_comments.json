Then i heard \"play wit yo bitch, and 100 shots\" and that made me look more into him and his music. Ever since i was hooked. I still remember where i was the day he allegedly died. I was cutting grass for the last time, and my wife sent me a text that dolph just died. Yes, i said allegedly, because i believe he was kidnapped and murdered days before he was \"murdered at makeda's.\" His own crew, fam, and many other people set him up.

Shit always cracked me up in a way but like in 100 shots I swear to god man the beat don\u2019t actually really drop until like 3/4ths of the damn song has played\u2026. But when it does shhheeeeee worth it. RIP DOLPH unfortunately this world just couldn\u2019t understand what they had. The only good thing to come of it is the fact that all the good ones in this world worth there weight are living in the ground. We can\u2019t never have nothing nice I swear. Especially in the hip hop world. It\u2019s gotten so bad I\u2019m waiting for got damn NBA and NFL players to start doing drills on each other. If you think about it it makes almost as much sense as this shit do anymore. I can guarantee if you was to ever ask someone like Von or Durk what they opps really did to deserve to die the horrible deaths they gifted them they wouldn\u2019t even know bruh. Can\u2019t y\u2019all see the system was designed in a way that even if y\u2019all do make it out the hood they\u2019ve got a way of causing you to be jealous over it instead of proud so you kill em over it. They made sure even when y\u2019all become successful you still lose and it\u2019s making me sick my brothers and sisters of color need to stand up and unite and once we\u2019ve smoothed out all those rough edges then we need to ALL get along together.

That's not to mention that he's still one of the best along with Lil Baby, Nav and Travis Scott. His style and voice are very remarkable, his songs with Snupe Bandz reaffirm that he is still an artist with a unique talent. Very outstanding songs like Here We Go, Ashtray and No Regrets please! More than anything No Regrets was a resounding success. My support is unconditional for YD, not to mention that their songs reach my soul and motivate me to make a better life and not settle for less. And why not look for a life with better economic well-being, thanks to him and all the artists I mentioned before because they show me that anything is possible.
