There's a reason most of the world, colonies freed from empires weakening in WW2, are still poor.

I know that Samsung is one of the major contributors of GDP in Korea, but I've never purchased a Samsung product knowing the kind of harm they bring to the country.

With the appropriate amount of consciousness and healthy feedbacks to the mega-companies we acheived what we call a better life. We are not slaves to the Jaebols because they know that treating us like slaves will end up in a shorter lifespan of their dynasty. Moreover, they competitively try to make better brand images to the country by providing better services and environments to the people.

I also used an HP laptop, and it took one month to repair. Apple is one of the few exceptions because many people use them to get the AS fast. and people like to buy foreign luxury bags because those things do not have repairing problems, usually. In conclusion, when people consider their budget, quality and A/S period, they usually conclude to buy the Korean product, even though foreign products seems to be better",

I also want to point out that the \u201cSamsung dream\u201d is a bit out of date. After our IMF crisis in 1997, chaebol companies like Samsung, with other smaller companies, ceased being lifelong workplaces. Many were fired and the age of retirement was pulled forward; people were now retiring at their 50s or earlier. Then came the unemployment, which is still a major problem in Korea, that changed people\u2019s desired jobs. Nowadays, people are leaning towards more stable jobs such as doctors or government employees that provide stable employment. The cutline for medical schools have been the highest out of all universities since 21st century in Korea.",
