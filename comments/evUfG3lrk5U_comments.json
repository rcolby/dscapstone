        "I have always wondered why a supernova wasn't even more powerful than they already are.\nSo, let say IF a massive supernova and GRB would happen at the same time nearby each other. Which of the 2 would overpower the other? Or would they instead of counteracting each other, rather reacting on one another and become something even more crazy powerful? I'm curious to what would happen when extreme cosmic events meet. I hope you can do a video about that.",

        "IIRC the simulations still fail to reliably reproduce how exactly the energy of collapsed core transmits into the rest of the star to cause it to expand. The shock wave is generated, yes, but it is not strong enough, and gets \"swamped\" by the infalling stellar matter. We assume that neutrinos \"somehow\" manage to pass a fraction of their energy to the stellar matter, but it does not exactly work when we simulate it quantitatively.",

Can you, or anyone, point me to a source that explains this? Because I was under the impression that all massive stars <8 solar masses go supernova and either form a neutron star or black hole.",

Like scientists were able to detect a Gamma burst affecting the atmosphere noticeably and it came from 2.6 BILLION LIGHT YEARS!?\n\nIf you can travel at half the speed of light (which is impossible to generate by humans for anything more than a particle ), and if you had started around when earth was made, you wouldn't have still reached the place where that supernova happened",

Has an amazing narrative in telling a scientific story and we all love a good story. Unfortunately I was also hoping for a quantum explanation to what happens when a star decides to go the other way and become a black hole. That would have been amazing!

        "Hello! Nice video and great explanations, so thank you!\n\nHowever, at 3:11 and in the following scenes, there are a few discrepancies regarding a star's mass and its life span... For instance, the R136 star cluster in the Tarantula Nebula, LMC, contains a number of stars that are well over 100 solar masses. Yet the cluster (hence the stars contained in it) is estimated to be 1-2 millions of years old. So how can Var 83, at 60 solar masses have a (total) life span of only 400k years?",

You do a great job but should look into stars going into micronova and other explosive \"events\" and have been categorized with titles of almost anything but the correct title. So before you state \"never explode\" you should do more homework. Even Isaiah says the sun will be 7 times brighter in one day.  See chapter 30:26 \"Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day that the Lord bindeth up the breach of his people, and healeth the stroke of their wound\".",

As far as I know muons are REALLY REALLY non-interactive, you even said it yourself in another video, so if muons were to come in contact with these particles they would just not interact with them. Interactions with muons are super rare... so either there were a true buttload of them or that was not the case of the extinction.",

Obviously, not every radioactive bit of material started decaying at the same exact time (or did it?), so what reference point is used for determining how much a particular sample has decayed? I know this is an important part of determining the \"age\" of many things (such as an ancient papyri found in an Egyptian tomb or coal formed by decaying trees or even when a clay pot was made that was found near a skeleton believed to be X years old).

        "Finally! My hours of watching @kurzgesagt videos were useful to understand 1 Veritasium video!",
        "I love the way scientists use the word \"recent\". Seriously though this explanation was so engaging. I wish science at school was this inspiring.",
        "The illustrations in this video are amazing. Very very well done job on this video.",
        "The Arabic record shown says a supernova occurred in 397 Hijri, around 1007AD. it started dark then increased in intensity and the shine varied between bright and dark until it eventually faded",
        "So dying stars begets\u2026dying stars? If supernovas create nebulas, which are the birth place of stars.",
        "This was tremendously well done - a great return after some very click-bait videos in the last year.",
        "nice! does the old video of ways humanity could be destroyed need to be updated with supernovae?",
        ":Our star has \"nova level outbursts\" every 12 000 or so years.\n:We are about to have another one.\n:That's why everyone is starting act more and more crazy.\n:As the magnetic field continues to collapse, the combination of cosmic rays and violet light are well, for a lack of a better word, overwhelming.",
        "Why the heck treat theories like truth?",
        "We would all die",
        "Really appreciate excellent videos like this one which explain for us laymen in terms we can understand the immense complexity of the universe which so many great minds have toiled for centuries to uncover. In this era of insane disinformation, this shines a brilliant light on truth. A million thanks!",
        "18:04 its ironic to hear Veritasium say without explosions of stars we wouldn't exist today, outstanding work on the video",
        "Facinating video as always, Derek. \nCould you please make a video in the future explaining the creation of heavier elements (r- process, s- process and p- process)?\nIt blows my mind to think of the extreme conditions required to create them. Makes me appreciate them that much more.",
        "I would love to see this happening right before my eyes. Crazy but it's fascinating!",
        "Good to know that!  Lol!",

        "The nutrinos would kill everything before the star blew up",
        "Ive had this vivid dream a few weeks ago about this!!  It put an agonizing dread within me. Something much more aweful than my own death. I was running through the halls of this grand school with window to ceiling windows to my right. 3 floor tall windows. It was night time, i was in the city wouldnt be able to see stars, but the beauty that was in slo mo ripple of blues and whites high abouv the sky against black nothing. My heart hurt so much when i woke up.",
        "I see you bested Kurzgesagt of about a week :)",
        "Sorry but this one was boring.",
        "Ur videos just... makes me so comfortable. They give me peace. Theyre so good",
        "lol how not hate war if  humans  only grow if we compete and now the only thing on earth to compete is ourselves",
        "4:08 why does not carbon nake diamond if their us Nessary amount of pressure and heat",
        "kurzgesagt made a similar video lol",
        "SuperNovas gave us life and it takeith away...",
        "do neutrinos bombs exist?",
        "You're amazing!",
        "Isn\u2019t this the most straight forward and obvious question ever? I\u2019m pretty sure that most people who heard this question would just assume it was rhetorical \ufe0f",
        "It happens every 12068 years like clockwork apparently to our own host star/",
        "I love how you stole this idea from gerzagaght or however you spell its YouTube video the other day",
        "YouTube has been trying to make me watch this for over a week now",
        "If you wanted click bait it should be titled \"Live  supernova explosion event eminent\"",
        "  Interesting. But when the US becomes a theocracy ruled by the Orange Jesus, we go back to thinking God created the universe a few thousand years ago.",
        "17:54 \"I brought you into existence and I can take you out of existence!\" ~daddy star explosion",
        "Nunca hab\u00eda visto una animaci\u00f3n tan intuitiva y detallada de lo que sucede en las estrellas al momento de su explosi\u00f3n. \u00a1Fue grandioso! Gracias. ",
        "You guys are going to see a demonstration in half an hour!",
        "So are all the elements heavier than iron created in supernova explosions?  Do these supernova sometime rip apart heavier atoms like iron, into lighter elements?  Is there any rhyme or reason to how much of each element exists in our universe?",
        "hate the title, loved the video :)",
        "Chandrashekar limit.... Indian science text books will never teach about it... Or the Raman effect!",
        "What will happen? People will take selfies with supernova!  ",
        "you're terrible in clickbait ....",
        "i  cant even watch... what a dumb question.  like duh it doesnt take a genius to figure this one out",
        "Crazy. Why do supernovas happen in such a short time? 6 months? Don't you think there is a time dilation in there somewhere? It makes no time sense.",
        "Isn't the speed of light in constant deceleration? How can we use it for dating or as a reference for anything?",
        "I really like the artwork and new-ish animation style you\u2019ve added to the channel.",
        "I always asked why we were in a place called the local bubble and Derek just answered my life long question",
        "Don't care",
        "I'm taking 90% of the credit for this video. You're welcome.",
        "The Universe gives, The Universe takes away.",
        "All I can say we still alive is just a miracle.",
        "I hope you pay someone to do the animations in your videos.  I would like to read the request emails.  \n\"Hello Mike.  How are the kids?  Could you animate a man putting his eye on a hydrogen bomb this week for me?\"",
        "We die?",
        "Incredible video. Very clearly explained and easy to follow for quite a complex subject. Great job!",
        "15:15 - I've been trying to explain this to people for so long....",
        "It's crazy to think something so astronomically far away can literally burn our skin on earth during hot days.",
        "Geez, this was a great video!",
        "Great video! Your videos always inspire me to explore our universe. Keep up the great work!",
        "How the F do these nerds DARE say what the lifespan of the sun is\u2026",
        "So something that's only made up of .01% light is a billion times brighter than a point blank hydrogen bomb?? That's wild!",
        "I just discovered this channel. What an amazing video. (And I thought I knew all about supernovas and how elements are made inside of stars!)",
        "Thank you everyone who donated, so glad to be apart of this community, so glad I was able to see the stream and donate what money I had",
        "Absolutely epic video Derek! Anything cosmological is always gonna hit the soft spot for an astrophysicist like me ;)",
        "Hey Kurzgesagt is one supposed to be causing existential crises, haha, great video, thanks for all the work you do!",
        "Missed opportunity for collab with Kurzgesagt!",
        "I never really understood what actually causes the explosion. No one else who explains supernova talks about neutrinos. They simply say when iron accumulates in the core the star explodes. Thank you for the extremely clear explanation.",
        "The Crab Nebula story was amazing. It's so easy to look up think of the night sky as static, but the entire universe is all moving faster than I can even comprehend.",
        "What proof do they have, A star is billions of miles away so how can they know what makes up a star and how it works ???",
        "That is really insanely powerful but there is only so much light our eyes can take",

        "Gamma ray bursts are basically life remover at galaxies range... Hardcore...",
        "Well, this is undoubtedly one of the best explanations about how stars and supernovas work I've ever seen. Science is one of those areas of life in which, just as soon as we think we understand a thing, we find out more about it--or in some cases relearn what we thought we knew. Thank goodness for the guide who takes us along on that journey and is just as fascinated along the way as we are (I'm talking about you, Comrade Derek).",
        "Dear Veritasium \nAt 8;22 you say that stars big enough to constrict to black holes do not produce a supernova explosion.\nand  at   16;08 - 16;25 you say that powerful  hypernova explosions in stars with more than 30 sm, produces black holes.",
        "You have a very bad day...",

        "7:48 That's considerate of stars to give us time to see them die",
        "Given the vastness of spacetime in our universe, it is so amazing to have such a violent type of event that occurs in a short enough time scale comparable to a human lifetime, yet frequent enough that we actually observe a number of them within our short history.",
        "I had no idea that the Crab Nebula was that young. 1000 years is nothing in the grand scheme of things.",
