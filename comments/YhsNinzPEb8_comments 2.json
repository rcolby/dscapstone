        "TV SHOW SUGGESTION\nDan browns the lost symbol is not only an interesting show with good acting, it has subjects and myths that would be fun to dive into. \nAt the beginning of the first episode it states a fact saying \"in 1991, a document was locked in the safe of the director of the CIA. Cryptic text includes references to an ancient portal and an unknown location. It also contains the phrase: its buried out there somewhere.",
        "Surprised the \"Runaway Train\" music video wasn't discussed. Something like 30 kids shown, 21 found",

        "My mom literally traumatized me due in part to this whole era. She once made me watch a documentary on stranger danger when I was about 5. She then put her finger to my head like a gun and asked me what I should do in that situation. I tried to answer, I think with running away, she just said, \"bang, you're dead. You can't run from a gun.\" And I started crying. I wasn't even allowed to cross the street alone until I was about 13. Saying I was sheltered would be an understatement.",
        "The south park episode about this was hilarious",
        "I'm surprised there was no bringing up of the fact that because of Johnny or more specifically his mother is the reason we now have the center for missing and exploited children.  Her story is long heartbreaking and inspiring all in one.",
        "How about those missing kid posts they did on TBS at the end of a episode \nWatching rips from vhs makes the end of e very Beverly hillbillies a little creepy now \nMakes you wonder if anyone knows what happened to those particular children and if it helped at all",
        "I remember reading a book as a kid called the girl on the milk carton about a kidnapped girl who was found years later and reunited with her family and how it screwed up her whole life and psyche, and i told myself if i ever found a milk carton kid i wouldn't turn them in.  Oddly i think that might even have been based on a true story.",
        "I hope you never stop sharing these random topics you find interesting! Your channel covers so much peculiar stuff that I haven't seen elsewhere.",
        "On the note of paranoia developing in kids, I often wonder how much of the stranger danger PSAs of the early 90's resulted into my anxiety. Because let me tell you, those were terrifying to watch. ._.",
        "I'm surprised the milk carton program continued all the way up to 2000. All this time I've thought that the milk carton program ended no later than the 1960s.",
        "It\u2019s crazy seeing you at almost 2 mil! I only started watching you at the beginning of last year and I think you only had about 15-20k subscribers. I\u2019m so happy to see how much you\u2019ve grown, you deserve every last bit of your success, congratulations man :)",
        "It literally feels as if all the good that it could obviously do was put into a gray area that honestly and truthfully doesn't exist in reality while all the bad it could potentially do was expanded in order to end this program.... Because literally this could do like no harm.... Literally at one point even though it was properly disgusting the video and dismissed but the comfort of one child should not even be considered on the other end sits just the HOPE of saving another.... Basically it sounds like a lot of excuses to stop something that only could do good and trying to make it look like it was doing something bad in order to stop an awareness for an issue that is not taken serious when it's more serious today than it was in the 90s and eighties and seventies because now we have film and this film paints a completely different picture of what these incidents may have been going down like back in the past... My issue with taking away the milk carton is that when you took away the milk carton you took away the community's ability to actively be a part of healing itself and it must now rely completely upon a chance encounter or the government doing its job correctly which both have very slim chances",
        "Can\u2019t watch you unless I put it on 1.25 speed. You. Talk. So. Slow.",
        "The sad part about stranger danger is that most of the time the kidnapper isn\u2019t a stranger to the kids,even if the parents are divorced,they\u2019ve known them their hole life, examples of missing people from non strangers are Elizabeth Fritzl who was kidnapped by her father when she was 18 for 24 years from 1984-2008, and Michelle Knight,Gena Dehesues, and Amanda Berry was kidnapped by the same man but all 3 knew him in some way as a nice man,one of them even knew him because she was friends with his daughter, Michelle was kidnapped in 2002,Amanda was kidnapped in 2003,Gina was kidnapped in 2004,they all knew him because he was a nice man in their community,Gina was the one who was friends with his daughter and were all found in 2013 because he forgot to lock Amanda\u2019s door and their next door neighbor helped her get out and got the other two out",

        "Anyone else find it suspicious that alot of these cases share one common theme, they all or almost all just so happen to be the first time they walk to school alone, deliver papers alone and so on. To me this puts the target squarely on the parents, maybe some falsely said they usually were with them trying to not look like a neglectful parent but does seem odd",
        "I'm glad our family was too big to buy milk cartons and we got gallon jugs instead",
        "So, a kid went missing near my hometown in fruitland Idaho and he didn\u2019t get an amber alert. Somehow he didn\u2019t \u201cqualify\u201d. \nI\u2019ve seen his name on billboards, on semi trucks, and even pizza restaurants and written \u201cfind Michael Vaughan\u201d. ",

        "It reminds me of Tom and Jerry",
        "Actually the other chap who said he knew Johnny Gosch as he was kidnapped by the same ring, his story has never been proven to be a lie, he also took a documentary team to a ranch where they were held and showed the team the carvings of their initials in the posts in the cellar! It was pretty compelling actually. And Johnny Gosch's mum and the other man said the ring had connections as high up as The Whitehouse! No wonder they shot it down quick!",

        "I actually benefited from this mania. There were like 3 different instances in which one of my neighbors (I live in an urban area) ended up on a list when I got older. I was a tiny afab kid who couldn't walk and suffered from moderate paranoia, so I never talked to any neighbors.",
        "One time my mother rode up beside me while I was biking around town and as a joke she said \"Hello little girl, would you like some candy??\" I thought this was hilarious but the diligent police officer parked down the road really got into gear to try and save the day ",
        "So glad you covered this topic, I was just talking about this with my mom a few weeks ago. I clearly remember seeing missing children\u2019s faces in a pizza shop on the tip jar & on the pizza boxes. Even now I\u2019m almost certain they still have a missing child image shown on the tip jar on the counter. It always makes me sad seeing the date when they went missing, some of them in the early 2000s & I remember some being from the late 90s. I truly do wish that all of them were just runaway kids or a parent or family member just taking them in the heat of things to then return them to safety, it\u2019s such a sad thought to think that they\u2019ll never be back home. Great video Wendigoon, thank you",
        "My sister was kidnapped a few year ago because of accepting a ride, not even from a stranger. Some of you might even know about it, it was pretty recent. Teen from NC got kidnapped and taken all the way to Mexico before she was found. Thankfully beyond all measure my sister miraculously was found but still.",

        "My parents grew up in Central Iowa and so did I, I definitely heard about Johnny Gosh. My mom sat my brother and I down one night and read us a book on stranger danger, and ironically we were just talking about it earlier tonight. She said my brother and I were polar opposites when it came to this kind of thing. She knew she didn't ever really have to worry about me trusting or talking to a stranger because she could hardly get me to talk to anyone but her and I ran from any unfamiliar situation ",

        "I love that Wendigoon always covers stuff I never really thought about. Like I knew kids were on milk cartons and suddenly they're not. So these videos are so interesting to me. And I love how he tells it. Also his sponsorships are hilarious so I don't skip them lol",
        "This topic is definitely something worth discussing, I know I was in great danger and went missing, my mom went to the cops but because I was an adult they just told her that they can\u2019t do anything because I\u2019m an adult , something has to be done but what would actually be appropriate , I still don\u2019t know , the fact my mom couldn\u2019t find me because I was 19 is absurd I wish she did or the cops could have \u2026this is definitely a topic worth discussing about people missing who aren\u2019t kids, every second is worth a life",

        "not old enough for the milk carton era but i remember being really young, five maybe, and my mom left me with my baby brother in an aisle of the store to grab something and a random woman came up to me and told me to watch out because someone could easily steal him\u2026i don\u2019t know why she would do this but it scared the hell out of me lmao",
        "I was actually kidnapped by drugdealers when i was 3. My parents found me and we had to live in another state out of a car for a long time. I kinda blocked that out for a long time, and i developed ptsd and brainshocks and it took years to realize what was wrong with me but im told it was form years of sustained trauma. This whole thing lead to me just growing up with anxiety and depression and fucking brainshocks. As a kid i thought i was just getting dizzy, like super dizzy, cuz brainshocks make you feel like your soul is wobbling one way, your body another and your brain in a 3rd pattern at once. It can happen from turning too fast, running, trying to balance. My dad thought I was a pussy because i gave up trying to ride a bike and i couldn't climb the tree house ladder he built and i didnt like doing all the physical activities he liked to do.  The milk cartons did not help. I would get nightmares with the kids on the cartons. The panic culture of the 80's just left me damaged and broken and unable to get any real help because psychiatrists were seen just like strangers too, and i lived where i saw crime and shit so i knew how real the dangers were and I was paranoid about it happening and i made sure to learn to talk like adults so they dont see me as just another kid.  I never learned to relax or let my guard down. Lead to me getting bullied for being weird and not wanting to go outside and play in the places where parents cant watch.  My mom thought i was a bit of a stickler and a buzzlkill all my life, like how did she raise such a square.",

        "15:52 so my parents were too old for the PSAs to effect them, and my brother and I were just a hair too young. Cell phones became commonplace for teens when I was in high school, but I got my first cell phone in middle school because my sister is disabled and if there was any emergency my mom could call me and let me know what was happening or I could call her if she was late to find out her ETA or find out if I needed to call my aunt who lived fairly close to the school to pick me up instead. I have a very vague memory of having a password for pick ups. But I'm talking early elementary school. My hometown was very safe. A quick Google search shows no known missing person cases involving kids from the town and the only adult cases were elderly people from a local old folks home, all of which have a high return rate because the police in that town get the exciting job of giving parking tickets at all the overpriced parking lots. Sometimes they have to handle break ins or package theft. But crime there is really rare.",
        "8:45",
        "Yeah the Johnny Gosch situation is still pretty decently talked about in Des Moines. Our news station ran a story about how police haven\u2019t officially closed the case and that they still will go back and sift through the boxes of evidence they have.",

        "I was growing up in the late 70s through the 80s in the Bay Area California. I remember stranger danger and the Kevin Collins case that is still not solved, and the milk cartons. In 1980 a little girl went missing in Antioch California and she was found dead in a ditch on James Donlon Blvd. In Antioch just up the road from my house. I remember all the kids in school after that no longer has their names on their lunch pales or on their clothing tags etc. Also parents and grandparents began picking their kids up from school religiously. Stranger danger went \"viral\" as they say now. Come to find out years later, her neighbor next door to her in her apartment complex the guy who even was her baby sitter several times is the one who took her and killed her. Not a stranger.",
        "I remember I'd gotten an amber alert once in January about a child that had gone missing in October. It honestly hurt to see.",
        "I was born in '88 and thought that was something that only happened on TV, like people delivering milk to houses. No idea it continued into the '90s, but we always got gallon jugs so the only milk cartons I had were those small cartons of sour milk that came with school lunches.",

        "A lady tried convincing me to enter her vehicle back when I was 8 in the early 2000s in a small town in Northern Ontario. I was close enough to home that I assured her I didn't need a ride. She even tried telling me that she knew the secret password my parents gave her, even though we didn't have one. When I wouldn't get in she started to panic/grumble and drive away. When I got home my parents didn't say anything to me about getting a ride, so I just put it out of my mind. Over a decade later, while watching a documentary about a child abduction, I connected the dots. It is very surreal to think about.",
        "As a kid, my mother would put a milk carton on the table at dinner time. She liked to believe that a big glass of vitamin D milk was the perfect beverage to compliment, well, anything. I could not even put a number on the amount of dot matrix printed faces of kids my age that I looked at while eating my dinner each night. I haven't thought about it much, but now that you mention it, that was pretty weird. You can get used to anything, I suppose. Personally, I think that it made have made me less aware because it normalized the fact that kids go missing all the time by building an association with something as regular as my family dinner time. Business as usual.",

        "The saddest stories are the ones where rebellious kids disobey their parents thinking they\u2019re gonna be okay despite having ignored the warnings, only for the worst possible scenario to happen to them shortly afterwards. Like imagine being in their shoes, you just want to discover yourself and try to be a little more independent and you\u2019re punished for it, you find out the warnings made sense but you\u2019re not going to live to learn.

I wandered about and at one point a man asked me where my parents were and I said I didn't know so he said he'd take me to them. We ended up going down (I vividly remember reaching the level where all the cars were parked) when suddenly another man appeared on the stairs below. The man I was with just abruptly turned and walked off and the new guy was confused as to how I managed to get so far down on my own, but he took me back upstairs to the nearest shop to call my parents over the intercom. To this day my family only know of the 2nd guy finding me. As a kid I didn't think much of the first one, but as I grew older realization dawned that he'd been taking me AWAY from the crowd, down to storage levels, and that he ran off to avoid getting caught, and it scares the living daylights out of me. I never will tell my parents about it because I don't want that What-If weighing on them.",

        "This video is dumb and downright absurd. I think these YouTube creator run out of ideas and out of shocking videos like this. The issue isn\u2019t the program of putting kids on milk cartons. The problem is the crime. Kidnapping young kids is a crime most kids won\u2019t survive. 99% of kids kidnapped and not recovered in the first 48 hours are never recovered. The kids put on these milk cartons are kids that were missing for months or years so the odds of finding them were always low. Just finding one kid from a milk carton would be like winning the power ball. Still it\u2019s better to post the pictures on milk cartons than not. The argument that it desensitized people is literally absurd. Do these people think it\u2019s better to not look for the kids? I don\u2019t get the argument here. This might be the dumbest argument of all time. Putting a kids picture on a milk carton doesn\u2019t guarantee they will ever be found. It does in tease the odds tho and nobody would argue this even if you hated milk. I can\u2019t even believe a video like this exists.",

Along with law enforcement, they established AMBER Alert and states began adopting the system because it was so effective. Although her death was a tradegy, we can thank Amber Hagerman along with her family for AMBER Alert so that her legacy, memory, and that her death has led to a system that saves many missing children so that hers may never be repeated for most children gone missing reported by the AMBER Alert system.",

        "The crazy thing about this is that this entire mindset literally NEVER went away afterwards. I grew up in the country and then moved to a suburban area in the late 90s. There was always this weird, unsubstantiated fear of kids getting plucked up and abducted by some mega creep murderer or something. I've tried to be more realistic with my kids, but my concerns usually lie in other kids rather than adults. I don't think a ton of adults are really going out to attack or abduct kids. There are some, of course. But kids are much more likely to be hurt, exploited, or worse from other kids in the peer group preceding their own (high school kids tend to prey on middle school kids and so on.) It's hard to calm yourself down when your kid's gone longer than they should be when they're just starting to gain independence. But it's also worth remembering that sheltering or stifling then will do far more harm developmentally than the miniscule likelihood that they're targeted by some panel van driving predator. Plus, you can always teach your kids to defend themselves. I teach my eldest the use of pepper spray, knives, and the people around them to help ensure he knows what to do if something bad should happen. But when I think back to the things I had to deal with and all the horrifying situations I've found myself in, I definitely understand the instinctual protectiveness.",

I spent my formative years traveling around in a VW Beetle with a dozen buffoons crammed inside. I was trained in juggling, balloon animals, playing the ukelele and picking pockets. I eventually escaped while we were working a mall in rural West Virginia and found a job as a coal miner. The dirt and dust were a welcome relief from the clown make-up and it was nice to go to work wearing footwear (steel tipped work boots) that wasn't four sizes bigger than my shoe size. And a coal mine is far less claustrophobia inducing than a '67 Volkswagen crammed with stinking greasy clowns with yellow teeth and bloodshot eyes. The VW had an 8 track and the only type of music the clowns played was  Death Metal (and of course occasionally Sondehim's \"Send in the Clowns,\" when they decided to mellow out  for awhile.  /s /s /s",

I DO think it was a step in the right direction, even if it had some issues.  I wish there was a way with Amber Alert to separate the custody-dispute-parent-abduction cases from the-child-is-in-real-danger abductions.  I know that some parents do present a real danger, but as with the milk cartons, the more cases (especially those that turn out to be \"Mom has the kids\") the more people will tune it out.  Our problem here in Texas, too, is that you might get an alert for somewhere hundreds of miles away.  The alert may be for El Paso, or Lubbock, or Houston when the hearer lives in Uncertain.  Familiarity may not always breed contempt, but it can make people more ho-hum about the alerts.",
        "A few notes on this video: The Johnny Gosch conspiracy theories go deeper and wider than what is mentioned here. Also, the theory of kids being kidnapped at sporting events- that was probably due in part to the abduction of Morgan Nick in Alma, Arkansas in the 1990\u2019s at a little league baseball game. It freaked out nearly every Arkansan mother for sure that their kid would be next. In Arkansas, the amber alert is actually called the Morgan Nick Amber Alert in her memory; she was never found. Also, this shows my na\u00efvet\u00e9 as a child- I can recall my mother always telling me to NEVER accept candy from strangers. She told me it was poison in disguise. It didn\u2019t dawn on me until I was about 19 that it was potentially drugs like GHB or some kind of sedative. Derp on me. Personally I never knew any kids to be abducted, but it seemed like almost every year some kid would run away from home or school but was usually found that same day. In high school we had a girl take off to go see her \u201cinternet boyfriend\u201d several states away circa 2000-2001. That was a huge fiasco. IIRC, she actually made it there but his mom called the cops on her and that was the end of that. That was THE TALK and gossip all school year.",

Two men in suits followed her around the store and she was sure nobody would help her so she ran out with us and left the cart. I always wonder what their intentions were. \nI also remember being 12 and hanging out by the pool with friends and an older man jogging around the apartment complex stopped and asked if we would like ice cream, everyone declined politely but my curiosity of stranger danger overtook me and I said sure. I followed him back with another girl my age who was urging me not to go the entire time. We got to his apartment at the very end of the complex and he pulled out a cooler with otter pops. We thanked him and went back to our friends. Nobody else ate the popsicles but me. I truly let the intrusive thoughts win ",
        "It was common for strangers to walk into people's homes and take their children back in the day. It happened to my great grandparents, grandparents, my dad and his siblings as well.

        "And I question your logic. Yes, conventional wisdom says the likely hood of finding a missing person of any age after 48 hours goes down dramatically, never being found, and being murdered are not the same thing. How many of them were stolen for other reasons? We don't know, so to just blanket say the pictures have no value, it dubious at best. At least as dubious as their effectiveness.",

I played in empty fields with my friends, rode my bike to school, went to the grocery store on my own, etc. No cell phones and no internet, so communication was done with a post-it note on the fridge. As a kid before the 2000s, you were almost always on your own, especially if both your parents worked. Having a healthy paranoia of strangers was a lifesaver when it came to being a kid. I think now it's not as useful since that paranoia has kinda transferred over to parents and adults who won't even let their kids play in the front yard, and are convinced the kid will be murdered if they're allowed to walk to school on their own.",

It is very rare for a child to be kidnapped by a stranger (so not just a divorced parent taking the kid) to be found alive. As depressing as it is, almost always, the kid is already dead before the week is over.",

        "The real problem with the whole stranger danger panic is that it\u2019s completely untrue. Absolutely, don\u2019t get into cars with strangers, but a vast majority of the bad things that happen to kids happen in the home. The vast majority of people who hurt kids are people the kids know, or even relatives like parents, uncles, siblings, etc. A lot of stranger danger rhetoric focused on very rare instances and told kids that the people they knew were safe, to go to your priest, parents, teachers, etc for safety any time you need. Those people were the ones most likely to take advantage of kids, in reality. Also that most missing childrens cases are unresolved custody disputes or runaways that show up within a week or so.",
        "My sister and I were two of the kids featured on the milk cartons. Our birth father kidnapped us during a custody dispute. He held my sister, who was 18 months old at the time, hostage with a gun to her head for 5 hours. He verbally, emotionally and mentally abused our mother. He punched our maternal grandmother in the face and repeatedly threatened to kill us. But the Utah family court system still gave him unsupervised visitation and in October 1983 he drove us to the airport and we boarded a flight to Texas, and from there drove over the border to Mexico. We spent the next year in the sole custody of a violent, psychotic, delusional man who emotionally, verbally and mentally abused us and also sexually abused me. Custodial interference is not a laughing matter, it's not something that should be dismissed. The assumption that parents are by default safe people for their children has resulted in Gods only know how many children being abused, raped, tortured and killed. Please don't make light of this. Also, Pete was dangerous because he was his mother's golden child. So he was entitled, spoiled and had no self control and took no responsibility for his own actions. Combine that with mental health issues he was born with and then being drafted and sent to Vietnam? You have an extremely volatile mix. Mental illness itself doesn't make someone violent or dangerous.",

In about 5th grade a kid in my class found a picture of himself on a milk carton and it scared us all. We ended up not being told until much later but his parents(who we all knew bc once again small town = no secrets) took him in and ended up moving without telling his birth parents who werent able to get back in contact with them. It shook our town for years and we were no longer allowed those cartons of milk. Apparently many of the adults in our city knew and just were fine with it! I ended up moving away at 16 but that kid never looked at his parents the same, heard recently he actually got in contact with his real family and is doing good.",
        "With the release of the Friend of the Family series on Peacock\u2014 which dramatizes the real life story of Jan Broberg\u2019s kidnapping and abuse by a friend of her parents, it has made think a lot about how the Stranger Danger movement overshadowed the fact that statistically, these things are more likely to happen because of someone you know. Stranger danger is important but it also led to a lot of \u201coh no \u2018Jim\u2019 would never do that to our child because we trust him\u201d- familiarity and trust are a predator\u2019s best friends. A better message would be to let children know there are certain things no one is allowed to do to them, no matter who that person is. And there\u2019s way to do that without traumatizing the children\u2014 teaching kids to have a sense of consent and bodily autonomy will help them understand when something is inappropriate or dangerous. That when they feel endangered or scared of someone, they are right in speaking up.",
        "I was so, so scared and paranoid about strangers when I was a kid in the 90s. I remember reading that exact Berenstain Bears Learn About Strangers book. There were always so many terrifying warnings about strangers back then, in books and videos and just seeing the missing kids' pictures on mail and stuff. I feel like it was helpful despite being terrifying, because I remember very quickly getting away from a couple of suspicious situations due to the intense fear from all the warnings. I wonder if the milk carton program as an unintentional warning ever helped to prevent any abductions during its run, just by scaring kids into a greater awareness of potential danger. I know there's no way to get solid numbers on that, but it would be interesting to ask people who grew up with missing kids on their milk cartons how (or if) it affected them in any significant way or specific situation.",

Sort of funny since the only times I\u2019ve been offered rides was from a classmate I lived near and walked home with offering me a ride to school in a blizzard and a couple times the father of one of my friends offered to drive me home (with my friend and all of their siblings in the car) which they had already done before with my mothers permission. Alas, blizzard walking and otherwise was my fate.",

I do not recall ever having seen missing children on milk or juice cartons or on pizza boxes or anything that came from the store or was picked up or delivered from a restaurant, no, they appeared in the mail and that happened at least once a week. Along with coupons and ads, there was always a section on the junkiest of junk mail items dedicated to missing children. Still happens these days and I still hadn't seen any of them. How that relates to me, I turned 10 in 1996, just a few months after the first Amber Alert and well before the advent of stranger danger, and yet even with missing children appearing on milk cartons, I was still given enough leeway to play outside or go around with my older siblings when such situations arose. As a matter of fact, when going over to my dad's house, it was common for us to walk as far as a park across the street from the hospital in town, the very same hospital I was born at if you care to know that, and never once before Amber Alerts or after did anyone ever try to get us to get into their car. Far more likely, we could have been hit by a car or fell into the river and drowned or something like that. Still, the possibility for someone to have tried to abduct us was there, but we had safety in numbers, I suppose.",
        "I think the worst assumption here is that strangers are always dangerous and have intentions and that parents are always good and care about their kids when neither of those things are true in all cases. My mom is great and my dad tries his best, but I know a lot of people who had abusive and neglectful parents who did not care or even purposefully hurt their child. I also know now that I am adult there are so many adults who would help a child and that assuming ever adult that you don't know is going to hurt you just creates unnecessary panic for all parties involved. Most kids get kidnapped by people the child already knows. What should be addressed is not who to look out for, but what behaviors and actions kids should expect from the people around them and what should never be tolerated. Teach kids that they should respect themselves and the people around and that they should expect the same behavior from the people who they interact with. Tell them what to do when a person mistreats them, whether that's a bully their own age or an adult. Believe kids when they report being mistreated. Teaching kids they shouldn't get in the car with people they don't is not a bad idea, because you don't know who a stranger is by the very nature of them being a stranger so you don't know what they want. It's not enough to keep kids safe though. We need to do better"
