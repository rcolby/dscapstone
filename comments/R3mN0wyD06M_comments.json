        "i love how sudden and chaotic this was",
        "In my opinion this is the worst episode of rick and morty ever made, only slightly worse than the fortune cookie one. \n\nIts like the writers are so desperate not to follow a standard format for a show they just come up with random ways to try and be original and subvert expectations of what a cartoon should be. Simultaneously they made the plots way too convoluted AND way too simple. ",
        "So this would mean the episode is going to be short. \n\nI read than shows like than have changing titles use then to time the episodes, so by making the opening tittles longers the episode can be shorter with no problem. Example: the simpsons",
