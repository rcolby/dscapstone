{"video_id": "4YkzzhI2EoI", "comments": ["Most people trying to translate Xi\u2019s words missed the most important part. Xi suggested Trudeau was lying to the media, what he had leaked wasn\u2019t how the discussion actually went.", "it must be so awkward being in situations like this right in front of cameras and reporters.", "Trudeau's wife: You're not supposed tell others what we do in the bedroom.\n\nJustin: In Canada we believe in free and open and frank dialogue, and it is what we will continue to have. We will continue to work together constructively but there will be things we will disagree on.", "What happened was. Canada couldn\u2019t even get a meeting with China officially, unlikely many countries that did. E.g. Australia, France, etc. Instead Trudeau bumped into Xi in the hallway, mumbled a few things. Xi obliged Trudeau to chat casually. Which should\u2019ve been treated appropriately as a gentleman hallway conversation, not a governed discussion. But then Trudeau went to his own press and claimed he victoriously championed many serious issues and concerns to Xi\u2019s face, he did it primarily for domestic political purposes. That\u2019s what Xi meant when he said that\u2019s not how the conversation was conducted. The \u201cleak\u201d wasn\u2019t about national security secrets, it was about a deliberate misuse of a hallway conversation.", "I bet he replayed this moment in his mind with all the things 'he should have said' that evening. Lol.", "Xi said \"too naive\" when he left Justin", "Trudeau should have acknowledged the leak while at the same time ensuring integrity of conversations in the future for the best interest of both countries. Mostly he wasn't prepared, or rather shocked to hear such direct confrontation fron Xi.", "Let me help translate what President Xi said to Trudeau,\n\n'Everything we discussed were leaked to the media, that's not appropriate, not the way sincere diplomacy should work'", "\u201cLet\u2019s create the conditions first\u201d sounds like, \u201cnow we\u2019re back to square one.\u201d", "imagine if they subtitled the second sentence correctly, there would be actual debate on if he was lying. now it looks like everyone is trying to cover up for him.", "It's not about freedom and democracy, it's about credit.", "justin trudeau was never seen again after this conversation ", "Xi basically said if u don't have the sincerity for top level discussion and keep leaking things to the media there won't be future dialogs.", "Need to look at this in the broader context of Canada-China relations in recent years.  Canada has clearly been doing what the US told it to do against China, including detaining the Huawei CFO a couple of years ago.  That issue was finally resolved a year ago after a series of secret negotiations between the US and China.  China has realized that the only Western country it needs to have serious dialogue with is the US.  China doesn't waste time with Canada, UK or Aussie anymore.", "\u201cIn canada we believe in free and open discussion\u201d Ha I almost died laughing", "The last phrase Xi said as he walked away (not translated) was \"very naive\"!!!!", "In fact, Xi's second sentence, \"\u800c\u4e14\u6211\u4eec\u4e5f\u4e0d\u662f\u90a3\u6837\u8fdb\u884c\u7684,\" was translated (by Xi's translator) as \"That's not how the way the conversation WAS conducted \" (I don't know why the subtitle is different), which really means, \"What you told (to the media) is not the reality of the conversation we had that day.\"", "i didn\u2019t know Trudeau is fluent in Mandarin. He didn\u2019t seem to bother finish listening to the translator", "As Xi was walking away, in response to Trudeau's meaningless remark which Trudeau made without letting the translator finish first, Xi said to his team: \"Truly naive\".", "Xi radiates \"I am not angry, I am just disappointed.\" energy.", "Leak confidential discussion between state of heads = Free and open and frank dialogue ", "Justin: A day without humiliation is a day wasted", "Truedo: But sir, in Canada we all speak freely and openly. \nXi: Have you never heard of the term \"privacy\"?", "Love the way how Trudeau walks away", "Trudeau did not even have the curtesy to wait for Xi's interpreter to finish before he started on his usual meaningless platitudes.  Those platitudes and his entitled attitude might be accepted by Canadians but they do not play on the world stage.", "I learned today that Canada put all conversations in diplomacy public as a way to show transparency", "the translator made a small mistake:\n\ntranslation of the second sentence, instead of 'not how the diplomacy work', what Xi Jinping actually said was 'that (information leaked to papers) was not how the conversation actually conducted', which basically means 'you are lying'", "That's a slap on Justin Trudeau\u2019s face .", "feels like when you do something wrong and a dad is just about to drop on", "Actually i didn't find comments pointing out that from 0:15 to 0:25, Xi said \"\u5982\u679c\u6709\u8bda\u5fc3\uff0c\u54b1\u4eec\u5c31\u7528\u4e92\u76f8\u5c0a\u91cd\u7684\u6001\u5ea6\u6765\u8fdb\u884c\u548c\u597d\uff0c\u5426\u5219\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7ed3\u679c\u5c31\u4e0d\u597d\u8bf4\u4e86\u201c, the whole sentence means \"if there is sincerity on your part, we can do the reconciliation with the attititude of mutual respect, otherwise the outcome could be unpredictable/cannot be said\". And the translator only got the chance to say \"if there is sincerity on your part....\" before interrupted by Trudeau. We have just witnessed how misunderstanding develops in international diplomacy. And that's why Xi said Trudeau was naive because he missed the most important part of the line.", "The Guardian didn't translate Xi's words on sincerity before Trudeau interrupted. Also I think it's very one-sided to put \"Xi interrupts\" when it was Trudeau who interrupted first.", "So fascinating to watch world leaders interact", "Now I am not a fan of China and their ideologies at this time but Xi had my respect in this conversation, he came to talk about the problem and Justin immediately went into defense mode.", "For those of you who dont know or didnt notice, the last word xi said is \u5927\u5929\u771f\u4e86 meaning 'too naive'.", "\u201cIn Canada we believe in free and open dialogue (unless we disagree with it)\u201d", "I replayed 20 times and more, I do not know why I love this video so much!", "Justin is that one friend\n\"Trust me bro, I won't tell anyone\"", "Frank and open dialogue doesn't mean you can leak a secret which you promised to keep.", "This is literally anyone when they bump into their not so close friend , start and end conversation awkwardly.", "cant believe guardian edito doesnt understand the english here.

Let's assume he speaks Chinese. No wonder Xi said \"Truly naive\".", "A true canadian heritage moment.", "Justin looks at Xi's eyes, but he's speaking to the camera, Xi looks anywhere but to Justin's eyes, yet he's speaking directly to him.", "Xi said, \"very naive\" in the end", "Just recently in Bulgaria, there was debate about open negotiations(between politic factions) and people speculating about politicians dealing under the table etc. What Xi states as concern reminds me of the unpopular opinion of my fav bulgarian politician, who stated that not everything must be discussed under wide public eye and there are thigns that should be kept private. Especially when we speak about different countries negotiating, trust is of superb importance", "in the last of the video,he said \"\u633a\u5929\u771f\" which means \"really naive\" lol", "I love how Trudeau quickly sauntered off to go cry in the men's room.", "Xi's response to Trudeau's \"In Canada we believe in\" speech is all of us when we call customer service hotline to complain about bad service but all we hear back is some generic scripted response that never addresses the issue", "Look at Trudeau\u2019s face expression after he left the conversation. It\u2019s like a school boy\u2019s embarrassment after leaving the principal\u2019s office ", "Can Trudeau ever say anything of substance rather than read and use cliche from a university textbook???", "The look on Xi's face as he walks away \n\"We'll see.................

Confidentiality is to be remained by both parties of the conversation unless a mutual agreement have been reached to go public. You want transparency then go talk in front of the cameras, they surely have abundant of those at G20. But if you want to go private, then keep it private! Simple as that.", "Honestly, Justin low-key looked intimidated by the old man.\nYou can see he tried to look firm and tough when he adjusted his stance, that's because he was intimidated.\nThat's what you get for electing a little kid to run the country.", "This is how my dad treated me when I was 9 years old - \"if you keep lying, you don't get chocolates. First stop lying\".", "Did I hear Trudeau say in Canada we have free and open dialogue, are you kidding me.", "As a Canadian,  I have to say Trudeau is a joke.", "You can clearly see the difference in Experience and professionalism between these two leaders. One\u2019s asking for high level talks that doesn\u2019t concern the news or media outlets while keeping a strong connection between leaders. Justin is not even ready on how to respond to that ", "The 2nd sentence in Xi's 1st statement \u201c... and that's not the way our conversation was conducted\".

Otherwise the outcome is hard to say\".

Sales manager Trudeau then pontificates about transparency etc. and added though we have differences we will continue to engage with you.  Xi cuts him off by saying, let's see, let's set the conditions first.  Xi then mutters, 'naive' ie what a small boy.
