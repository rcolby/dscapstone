A/S is very fast. Because their market domination is large and there are so many branches, so when my  LG laptop, Samsung phone, or Hyundai car has a problem, I can fix it on the same day by visiting the brand shops at very low cost. I also used an HP laptop, and it took one month to repair. Apple is one of the few exceptions because many people use them to get the AS fast. and people like to buy foreign luxury bags because those things do not have repairing problems, usually. In conclusion, when people consider their budget, quality and A/S period, they usually conclude to buy the Korean product, even though foreign products seems to be better", "\"Corporations can't run countries.\"\n\nSam is gonna freak out when he finds out about United Fruit Company", "I am Korean and I am very amazed by how accurate this convoluted riddle was explained. Although I would say, it is bit exaggerated about all Korean people want to get into Samsung. It is a stable job with a good pay but that doesn\u2019t mean it is the best.", "In some ways, getting employed by Samsung or any family-run multinational companies in South Korea is almost like becoming a worker of a stable public service job in some countries: job security and pensions are guaranteed as well parents will be gleefully happy & grateful knowing that their grown-up children are working in one of the chaebol companies that promises lofty benefits.", "This video is incredible. I actually was there in Korea as a teacher when much of this went down, but as a foreigner who only spoke limited Korean, I certainly didn't get the whole story.

The logistics of corruption tempered by pragmatism. I was glued to the screen. <3", "Chaebol is the romanization of \uc7ac\ubc8c which means \"wealth clan\". This word can be written in the same characters as the Japanese zaibatsu (meaning financial clique), as both these words have Chinese roots. The Japanese zaibatsu (or keiretsu nowadays) were powerful monopolistic conglomerates of pre-war Japan, with four big ones. Sumitomo, Mitsui, Yasuda, and the most famous being Mitsubishi. They were broken up by the GHQ (General Headquarters; another name for the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers during the American occupation) but later on loosely reconstituted.", "It really is a brutal moment when you realize that you have to keep something/someone even if they're bad or problematic because you need them.", "Actually, Korean National Pension Service is the largest shareholder in most of popular Korean companies, just as Samsung group subsidiaries. Like Samsung,  LG, Hyundai, and SK are facing same situations against Korean government. That's why Korean government has quite a lot of power to shake over 'chaebol' groups.", "I'm an American currently living in South Korea. It is insane how much brand loyalty there is here. Literally every phone in the country is a Samsung (I've never seen so many foldables in my life). Every single car on the road is a Kia or Hyundai. Every appliance is an LG or Daewoo. And Lotte and Kakao are everywhere too. I've lived all over the world and never seen a country so loyal to its own brands. It's actually kind of admirable.", "Samsung isn't just an electronics giant as many outside of South Korea view it.\nIt's in insurance, heavy engineering, real estate, banking and finance, recreation, healthcare, precision equipment, military technology, and so much more.", "Interesting topic.

They're pretty old but recently have made huge gains in the market and closed in on the likes of LG and Samsung. They're not as close as Samsung's sister companies but their weapons production group dominates the market. They've also purchased Samsung's weapons and systems arm in the early 2010s. I think we'll see many scandals or controversies surrounding their operations for years to come. They basically have a chokehold on the south Korean arms market and even surpasses the revenue of Raytheon and Lockheed Martin etc. in some markets.", "What I felt while living in Korea\nTo the Korean people, Samsung has a strong image as a national team that represents Korea and earns foreign currency in the world market rather than dominating Korea.", "South Korea is an example of State Capitalism, when a corporation is too big that you can no longer distinguish it from the state it's depending on.", "Geographically speaking, all four \"East Asian Tiger\" economies should be poor. Yet Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan are considered \"miracle economies.\"", "South Korea's government directed industries are a pretty interesting case study. I was very impressed by their planned initiatives to evolve into a media powerhouse. SK is sort of a capitalist oligarchy with central planning and an insane focus on education.", "I recently watched the Vice documentary about the cancer victims at the Samsung Electronic factory and how Samsung, the government, the Ministry of Labour and the police all worked together for 11 years to take the victims to court and try deny what they did. Of course there was very little payment compared to hospital costs, court costs and labour fees paid (11m split to dozens of families) with no one sepping down or any change being made to stop corruption like that happening again.", "You realize how influential the Chaebols are when you look into just how much control they have of their respective industries in ROK. Sure we no longer have a better performing economy than the ROK, but we're still proud of what we have (like mineral wealth).

Living in Korea had such a deep impact on me and it was such a fascinating and frustrating experience. This video really explains so much about it's culture  - obviously not everything but so many key things. One of the things that struck me was the connection of NPS and the President to Samsung was so indicative to how the culture communicates. When I was a teacher, I NEVER heard any feedback directly from my boss or even colleagues that sat next to me. Everything was indirectly communicated to me through 2-3 people.", "The whole thing is predicated on their ability to predict their own deaths.
