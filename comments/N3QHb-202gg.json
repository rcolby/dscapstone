He always respect us, the audience, and his team, and he is always polite in all of his videos. We congratulate ourselves on this achievement. More to come and everything to come :( =)", "I can't wait to see the HUGE amounts of MP content. No way will they push MP aside for Warzone and DMZ to encourage people to spend money on overpriced skins. This is a developer and publisher with the utmost integrity and best interests of the fans at heart!", "The fact that this man can derive humor even in the most peculiar circumstances shows how goated he truly is :-)", "battle pass system is truly.... a feature of gaming today", "This really is one of THE battle passes of all time.", "Welp! This seems to have more in 1 season than 2042 has had in 1 year.

Also can\u2019t wait for the combat record tomorrow!", "Can't wait to unlock the Battle Bass!  0:58", "Hopefully the actual grind of earning those tokens isn't too long because this already looks far better then the normal battle pass system", "Nothing gets me more excited for a new game than knowing I have to grind out 100 levels of a battle pass. Let's go!", "As a loooong time Battlefield player, it is great to see CoD doing so well with its playerbase. Unfortunately it's not my type of game but I wish it raises the bar further and further.  In BF2042, it took us months until they announced season 1... gosh", "Other than sbmm the game is fun af.  Wish there was more casual pups without having to to tank", "I actually love this idea. I can choose what path to take without forcing to choose things I do not like first.", "We havent even gotten the full game we paid for but now we should already pay more for more content. ITS LIT CALL OF DUTY!", "that tier 100 skin takedown tho in the end", "This actually looks sick. I'm always down for something new. 1st time in a while that I'm actually excited to play MP agian.. and now that warzone 2.0 drops tomorrow I'm even more pumped. ", "Love the videos! You put so much time and work into them and they make my day better", "I mean, the battle pass idea is interesting.

", "Love the looks of this. I was SO sick of the previous system which was nothing but a playtime tracker, that was not satisfying at all and near impossible to finish for casual players. Looks like there is still some filler to go through in this pass system but at least it should feel faster and more rewarding for gameplay.", "Hmm this setup seems interesting and unique, almost like a skill tree. Be interesting to see it tomorrow with how the 50 tier boost works for all those who got that edition.", "1st season: real soldiers fighting\n3rd season: clowns and minions fighting with rainbow weapons", "7:15 that timing cannot be any more perfect XD\nI love Coryxkenshin so much, he just makes my day!", "The fact we can choose our paths now on top of not being forced into doing challenges to progress like other live service games is great. \nI want to progress from playing and nothing more.

The old 1 to 100 tier grind was getting a bit old.", "Always liked this concept of being able to pay for each season BP by actually playing the game and earning ingame currency.

Was very sceptical but end up loving it.", "This is a huge step forward. Once again. Thank you IW for leading the way", "Anyone else seen the shadow company with sunglasses i hope there comes operator challenges so you can get the one with Night vision like mw2019", "Can\u2019t wait for the dope skins down the line", "This is pretty interesting.  Reminds me of the Final Fantasy X sphere grid.", "Let's go, these skins look sick. Give us more milsim vibes!", "Ok this looks interesting, excited to see how it actually works out.", "Awesome I\u2019ve always loved the call of duty franchise but this game was awesome and still is", "I think this is definitely a unique way to do a battle pass, I\u2019m honestly sick of the system by now but this one is at least different enough", "I love how Roze couldn't resist putting back on the Shadow Company uniform even though it's not as bad the 2019's version.", "Excited to see how the sector battle pass system will work", "I can't wait to complete this battle pass to achieve total victory!

Add demolition mode ", "This is a developer and publisher with the utmost integrity and best interests of the fans at heart!", "Best COD so far in recent years!", "This game gon be such a sucess ", "Can't wait to spend 5 hours just to unlock a single reward", "0:26 looks like the gold completion version of the Zeus operator mentioned on the website. Impressive ", "Okay, I kinda like the idea of being able to choose what to work toward.

Well you work you just did it in a different way!", "Looks awesome can\u2019t wait", "\"Victory is in your hands if you pay $10 dollars\"", "Only thing I care about is that back breaker execution ", "So instead of going through tiers you can get what you technically depending on what you play? Interesting but can't wait man hope this will maje me relive the early days of warzone the best days.", "Devs really took a look at the map in Ghost Recon: Wildlands and said \"We should do our Battle Pass like that!\"", "So getting the vault edition with 50 tier skips, does that mean all the item are unlocked and usable or do we need to play to get the battle tokens to unlock them?
