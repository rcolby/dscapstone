Do this before Christmas: The Home alone challenge is a game that u play with the boys (just sapnap and George.) You have to make a house or spawn one in and you have to set traps and the boys have to break in and murder u without u dying. You aren\u2019t allowed to actually hit them and u can only win if u successfully survive within one hour or if u successfully call the police without dying (u can\u2019t call the police until 1 hour passes) You pick how u win but that\u2019s the rules.

        "Will you go to Heaven when you die ? Have you ever Lied, stolen, used Gods name in vain (such as OMG), Had sex outside of Marriage ? Truth is...We have all sinned and broke Gods laws. And sin is what sends us to Hell. But even though we broke Gods laws, God being rich in mercy sent his son Jesus born of a virgin. He lived a sinless perfect life something we could not do. He willingly went to the cross and took the punishment we deserve by dying on the cross for our sins. Then 3 days later rose from the dead and was seen by hundreds of eye witnesses and then ascended into Heaven where he sits at the right hand of God. So please today put your Faith and trust in Jesus before its too late.",
