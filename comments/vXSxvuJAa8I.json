The moment you've heard the music, the fight has begun.", "I love how a christmas song Mariah made years and years ago has stuck in our society's collective unconscious 1, long enough, and 2, significantly so; to the point where everyone associates it with the season SO HARD that most can recognize it from the opening piano notes.  And we are all terrified of what her song represents.", "It haunts us every year\nWe never expect it\nBut it happens every time", "Regardless of one's feelings for Halloween, this rings true. One holiday is over? NO! THE NEXT HAS BEGUN! No holding back, no concept of less than maximum overdoing it! You will PADORU NOW!", "The joke I always like to make is that if there really is a War on Christmas, Christmas is winning by absorbing the other holidays.", "Can I just say how much I wish I could find a relationship like what Jo and Echo have? They're so sweet and wholesome together and I really just wish I could find that special someone who I could make happy for the rest of their life. But seeing them also gives me the hope I need to keep trying. So thank you both for that.

I probably would love Christmas more if people weren't so obnoxious about it.", "I\u2019ve done worked at supermarkets for 8 years now, and I see this Christmas stuff seep in through the cracks as far as august. It\u2019s only that the damn finally bursts on November first.", "Ah yes a classic. I actually walked into work blasting Collective Christmas. It\u2019s Collective Consciousness from MGR but sung to the tune of All I Want for Christmas.", "Are you tellin' me Jocat keeps a sword hung on his coat hook but not a shield nearby??", "Every year, the Christmas beast creeps closer to the salt ring surrounding October 31st. I fear one day it'll breach that ring, but those of us who love Halloween must stay strong ", "As the singing started I simply went \"Oh no...\"\nThen the music.\nAs Jo approached the door all I could muster before the white mass of Holliday cheer flew out of my screen was \"MARIAH NO-\"", "The amount of fear i had when the first few seconds of the song came on was horrifying", "I love this. It\u2019s so silly.

Nice.", "Man, feels bad that thanksgiving is always being stomped out", "The second I heard it I knew exactly where it was going, perfection.", "Fun fact: Here in the UK we started seeing Christmas items in our local shops in F***ING AUGUST this year. They didn't just skip Halloween, they skipped the entire season of Autumn!", "Hahaha  \n\nYep, literally that. On November 1st all the stores that had Halloween decorations on sale started selling X-mas decorations...it is scary how fast they can made this transition man ", "What always gets me is people who start preparing for Christmas when Halloween comes around.", "Hilariously sad, but true. I'll never forget the shops and grocery stores replacing all traces of Halloween... on Halloween... with Christmas junk. It's like a Peppermint Mocha Onslaught, rolling over the Pumpkin Spice Latte and Thanksgiving.", "THIS WAS PERFECT! Its so rewatchable, and relatable on all counts from the loss of Halloween to the Christmas Creep", "As someone who works in a grocery store I pray for me and my coworkers sanity", "To anyone dealing with that terror that is that song, remember, it fits perfectly with Weclome to the Black Parade", "I love how relateble it is. My father and I have to wait until the 1st December to sing Christmas songs. It's a rule from my mom 'cause she got fed up and we hate it.", "Shoutouts to Halloween.

Smart guy. Prepared.", "This is exactly how it is!!! All this year I\u2019ve been waiting for the moment of Halloween, and there\u2019s just Halloween ads, coupons, decorations EVERYWHERE.

It's the most wonderful fourth of the year. Christmas really is becoming an Eldritch horror that threatens to consume all other holidays.", "You always know it's coming, but you can't help but dread it.", "It's getting worse by the year, many stores started selling Christmas themed food, decorations and advent calendars way before Halloween already... And as many already said, now that Halloween is over and a bit of shelf space gets freed, the Christmas junk time is upon us again.", "My friend and I drove from California to Oregon on November 1st. We were both admiring the beautiful fall foliage before I saw, looming over us through the fog, a snow covered mountain. And before we knew it, BAM! SNOW EVERYWHERE!

The greatest holiday is over, now we are subjected to two whole months of... Christmas. Shudders", "And this is why I start celebrating Halloween the moment June ends.

That\u2019s how visceral of a reaction I have to THAT at this point. ", "This one hit too deep.
