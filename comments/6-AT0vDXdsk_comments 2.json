        "My favorite YouTubers and racers. Justin, your words are true, and come from the heart. I feel your anguish. Jackie, carry the good thoughts forward in your life, wherever you go. I lost my mom several years ago quite unexpectedly, and though time takes you further away from that moment of separation, you will carry those wounds forever. People say it gets easier with time. It does not. You just learn how to press forward, and carry the spirit of your loved ones with you. That's all we can do. As I remind myself daily, No one gets out of here alive; it's all part of the great circle of life. I'm a brain cancer survivor and legally blind so I for one can tell you, you never know what trials and tribulations the next day may hold, so teach yourself to be thankful for what you have had in the past; family, friends and love, and accept what comes tomorrow with open eyes and an open heart. You will be okay. Trust in that. Honor the memories of your dad and what he stood for and lead a righteous life. That's all we can do. .much love and respect to the both of you, and your family.",

        "Sorry for your lose homie",
        "The world was a better place when you'd get made fun of at a Tractor Pull in Kentucky for having exhaust like that. It sounds like it's drowning and it looks like a mobile toll gate. When people walk by bull horns I often wonder if they don't just toss change in naturally. On a positive note- It's hard having a black racecar and keeping the paint nice, the car is exceptionally purty. The fab and wiring seems very purty too.  While originally not a fan of this body style, I love seeing anything other than the 4 cars currently popular as a tire smalls and I think you should get the hit against any racer who mis-placed the doghouse back at the barn. That car is way too classy for street racing around these parts. I'd hit up a good bike blessing at the nearest Legions this spring.",
