        "I watched it live and was glad it got off the ground but just couldn\u2019t get all that excited about it. This could have been done 30-40 years ago, old equipment, old design, old thinking, nothing reusable and all a bit sad compared to what the private sector has done in the last 10 years. I know it\u2019s not totally NASA\u2019s fault as they have politics to deal with but they are stuck with this design for what 5-10 years now, when SpaceX can do the same job a lot cheaper.",

        "I wish there was better coverage from NASA. It'd be nice to have two streams, one for toddlers and the other for us rocket geeks. I'd be more happy with telemetry and launch/mission control audio than listening to commentary.",
        "I've been looking forward to watching your video on our launch for most of my career!  Thanks Scott!",
        "with all the news over the last several years, I just assumed this was gonna be blowed up after launch",
        "06:47 am for me still watched it and I agree it was really bright",
        "We finally see the space shuttle fly to the moon and even orbit the sun. And people said it can't be done :-)",
        "such a great launch. looking forward to the rest of the mission now :) thanks for the vid Scott",
        "Listening to the velocities on the launch commentary, I have to say that I believe that SLS achieves higher velocities quicker than any other launch system that I'm aware of (hello, 8 million lbs. of thrust!).  Would love to know what kinds of G forces that the occupants will experience.",
        "Amazing images.\nTerrible puns.\nCongratulations to NASA.\nGreat update Scott!",
        "HOLY COW NASA STILL FLYS A B-57!!!! Wow!",
        "Fantastic shots!  I was more than curious about all that off gassing, and Scott acquired a cabin shot also!  Very cool ",
        "engines faal into the sea.... so they are useless then?????",
        "They should put more cameras on the rocket. Well gopro is cheap right compared to NASA budget",
        "Was it just me or was the takeoff acceleration from the sls extremely fast compared to other rockets? ",
        "It is difficult to launch a rocket, but not always so hard. This rocket got off half caulked.",
        "I think this video basically sold a million Nikon P1000s didn\u2019t think they would be that good at night ! Thanks for the coverage ",
        "NASA could have put cameras on the actual rocket so we can see it live instead of having to watch some crappy computer animation after the launch. Felt like a broadcast from 50 years ago.",

        "SpaceX Starship development began in 2012, when Elon Musk, CEO of American aerospace company SpaceX, first publicly described a high-level plan to build a reusable rocket system  Going on 11 years. Elon is quoted promising 100's of humans on Mars by 2016.",
        "your telling me they launched the SLS, after all this time and money, WITH GOPRO 4's?! WTF?",
        "Liked, subscribed and comment for the algorithm. Thank you for all the great content you present.",

        "Now that was a deep date up space!",
        "SpaceX has this type of data and video down to a science, unfortunately NASA does not.",
        "Wonder if there will be any mention of this on twitter ",
        "Was thankful that do to timezone differences that I was able to wake up later than I wanted to tune in where they were paused before the Flight Directors Poll at T-10:00, caught the last 30 secs on through 9 minutes into flight on screen recorder to forever have it on my phone and thankfully our crappy internet didn't die during launch so it's all just one straight video, can't wait for Artimes 1 to splash down and for the rest to take flight in the future",
        "Can't wait for angry astronaut to make a video about this launch",
        "I\u2019ll be satisfied with this program when and only when the gateway station is in place. Until there\u2019s a maintenance-requiring multibillion dollar piece of equipment that they can\u2019t just stop flying to, the risk of the program getting Apollo\u2019d will remain, even when we\u2019ve put human boots down in the regolith. We need that hard guarantee that the program can\u2019t be cut. (And honestly, with ISS nearing the end of its lifespan, they should really start designing additional modules for gateway to enable it to take over the roles of ISS in international off-earth research. Then we can start sending crews to the moon\u2019s area routinely).",
        "Pretty much any sentence with the phrase \"caulk rocket\" in it is going to be funny.",

        "I thought that the flames were crazy long, those SRBs are so violent",
        "Most Kerbal space mission ever: Huge!!! Boosters!!! Way over budget!!! Took AGES to get something actually off the ground and into space!!! Just started with the old save file of the last mission because the parts (SRBs, engines, orange tank) are loaded to save time, but it actually took longer!!! Tacked on a bonus probe just because we have an actual working rocket!!! Left it out in a hurricane because we're behind schedule or whatever, and maybe the wind was a bit higher than what was ok, or not, but it's totally fine, just send it!!!!  RTV may fall off in flight, no worries, autostrut it!!! Red team totally walking right up to a loaded up rocket leaking hydrogen to make a few tweaks!!!",
        "how do they plan artemis' return such that it doesn't collide with any of the objects circling the earth ?   I've seen the Norad images that show the crazy number of objects in earths orbit, so it seems like it would be a difficult task.",
        "8:42 I love this image. 'Oh, you think playing a flight-sim with an ultra-wide monitor is cool? We're flying a spaceship, checkout our rigs.'",
        "I think those guys should get some hazard pay for going out there to fix the leak.  ",
        "The plume from the SRBs seemed to me to be larger than what we saw with the shuttle, even for a night launch. Does anyone know if it was because of differences in photography equipment, or if they actually were longer because of other factors like the 5th segment or proximity of the core stage's engines affecting the plumes?",
        "Do they have controlled re-entry this time?",
        "I was lucky to be close to see it go off. It was a surreal experience and my first rocket launch. Extremely loud, almost like hundreds of bombs going off at the same time. Well worth it, was one of the most beautiful things ive ever seen.",
        "poor on board video compared to Space X",
        "Some amazing photographs",
        "Wow... the NASA crawling logo on the boosters. I didn't expect to see that after more than 20 years!",
        "Thank you very much for sharing my video. Being able to see the launch in person was truly an amazing experience. Just amazing.",
        "My son is 2. I'm excited to see him be of age to see another person step on the moon!\nForget the fact I'll live to see it too.",
        "It's very poor that those SRB's are just allowed to be dumped in the sea and forgotten about....not very eco friendly is it! as a minimum they should be recovered and disposed of properly.",
        "Thank you, Scott for getting me into KSP way back in the early 2010\u2019s!\n\nThrough that game - I have learned so much about rockets and playing with many realism mods, I\u2019ve grown to understand why flight plans for rockets are the way they are. I also understand things like why solar panels have to be folded back in for burns and other such small details through a combination of KSP and also being a car mechanic (understanding stress on components and various other things). It\u2019s so liberating to be able to follow along with something like Artemis and understand what\u2019s going on every step of the way.  I don\u2019t think I could\u2019ve had that without your KSP tutorial videos back in the day. Thank you again!",
        "You were kind. The official coverage absolutely sucked. You failed to mention that we had a countdown, T-minus 10, 9, 8.. etc., got to zero and..... they cut to pre-recorded footage.  No ignition, no indication of why, no word of what was happening, just pre-recorded clips about the mission.  This lack of information went on for quite some time, like 45 minutes! It was something like t+45m before this thing took off?  I'm not sure if they reset the clock after the initial countdown, I had given up on them by then.  It might feel like a win that this thing actually took off after all these years, but was it a win?  Do you really feel like this beast is ready to take humans to the moon?  The shoddy coverage and delays leave me feeling like this program is a waste of money. I certainly wouldn't trust this enough to put a human on board.",
        "It was a magnificent achievement to get this jobs program, oops rocket, finally launched.   It just seems to be completely not the cutting edge machine in 2022.  If this had occurred 10 or 15 years ago we would all be complementing NASA on the cutting edge technology.  However now, when a double booster landing by SpaceX even becomes routine, this rocket just seems old.  Throwing away all that hardware, some of it specifically designed to be reusable, just seems like a terrible waste.  Even the inside of the Orion seems like a older model car.",
        "we have people living on the streets and under bridges and veterans that need assistance. But ya know yeah we\u2019re gonna fly a manikin around the moon. It\u2019s so jacked",
        "I'm kind of aggrieved by the fact that NASA wasted over 50 years of my life before going back to the moon.  We could have been on Mars by now!  Okay, Boomer, get over it.",
        "I don't want to be a party pooper.. but after 11 years and billions waisted..  IT'S ABOUT TIME ..",
        "Salvage space mission.",
        "8:52 I'm nostalgic for the Apollo era control center. Desks with computer monitors could be anything. Would have been nice to have 1960's Apollo styling for the desks and the room. That's just me I guess.",
        "I'd rather have them delay be cautious and take the time they need rather than launch and have a failure that wastes a bunch of my tax money.  I have no problem spending the money, but not taking prudent steps of caution would seem like a waste.  I'm really good it went off successfully, regardless of the schedule.",
        "So you can talk the talk but you can't caulk the caulk?\n\nBadumtish.",
        "Why don't they recover & re use the boosters?",
        "It would have been brighter if it exploded,, so there is that.",
        "What an incredible launch.  So happy I made the 18 hour drive to see it lift off in person.",
        "I started to watch the strem about close to T-15 minutes.",
        "it's good to see the doubters in SLS proven wrong. go Artemis, and go NASA!",
        "What an amazing thing to watch. Orion is finally on it's way to the Moon. If all goes well and it gets back to Earth we will finally be sending humans back. Fingers crossed that it does all it's supposed to....but there is still loads of things that could go wrong.",
        "What a tragic waste of those historic engines and rocket segments. Don\u2019t know why the boosters weren\u2019t recovered in the same way as the shuttle.",
        "caulk rocket? this is SLS not New Shepard",
        "And a big thanks to SpaceX for their rapid development cycles, inspiring the SLS team to get their rocket off the pad at last.",
        "So 53 years on from Apollo, and this is the best NASA can do? A bunch of recycled parts, and a one time use craft. My nephew asked what Artemis was all about, so we looked it up and NASA\u2019s mission statement begins with \u201cNASA\u2019s Artemis mission will land the first woman and person of color on the moon\u201d, because of all the things that returning to the moon could mean for humanity, an astronaut\u2019s skin tone and reproductive plumbing are apparently what we need to focus on, and not humanity\u2019s re-engagement with crewed exploration of another celestial body, or the program being the first step in establishing the first human outpost beyond low earth orbit, or perhaps that Artemis is the first step in expanding our civilizations sphere of influence out past our home world, no no no what\u2019s most important is the sex and melanin content of the astronauts. NASA making this the first line in their mission description does nothing but cheapen the entire thing. because listing the landing of a woman or a person of color as a top priority is as pointless as it is meaningless. let the program and the astronauts speak for themselves through their deeds and accomplishments, and not have their immutable physical characteristics be their qualification and accomplishment.",
        "Brightest launch in history?  I'd say Apollo 17's night launch with the Saturn 5 rocket was just as bright.",
        "its also that aluminum perchlorate is a particularly bright burning reaction",
        "You crack me up dude",
        "N/\\S/\\ choice to give the go, predominantly was due to visibility of flare projector (including reputation) path. But the lack of professionalism displayed on constant updating at scrub & sea discarded tins.",
        "Scott, you showed some really beautiful shots of the launch.  Thanks and thanks to the folks who took them!",
        "The Russians may have had brighter launches, but only because they BLEW UP",
        "I was wrong I thought it was going to burn and die, im so glad I was wrong  go sls",
        "The new SRBs are disposable , no casing segments , no O rings to worry about leaking.",
        "Aww man, all those hours spent watching all the scrubbed launch attempts, and they had to actually launch it this time around when I was halfway through my night sleep here in Europe!!\nThe only consolation in all this is that it was a night launch, which doesn't usually provide stunning onboard footage, and with Scott saying the live coverage wasn't that great either, I feel better losing the live coverage.",
        "Launch coverage sucked compared to Space X's coverage or theirs.",
        "Still can\u2019t believe that this Big Orange Joke finally launched after more than a dozen years \u2026",
        "Coverage was crap. What a disappointment. How can we just watch a bad rendering for so long?",
        "You had me at Caulk Rocket.",
        "Still not a big fan of SLS as a rocket program, but damn that launch was stunning! We were going, and now we went!",
        "Where is Shaun the sheep?",
        "Big balls on the Red Team. Imagine a slipped torque wrench making a spark ",
        "Launch coverage was disappointing tbh. Guess they ran out of money for on vehicle cameras lol",
        "so its a bastardisation of shuttle, constalation and orion missions",
        "That caulk rocket was inserted into the upper atmosphere after it went off and it shot its load into space",
        "somebody needs to give the red team a GoPro, they deserve all the publicity for their bravery",
        "It's too bad NASA did such a poor job of at least telling us where it was as far as down range, altitude, speed, etc -- even for TLI they just kept repeating the speed, but didn't really show a map or anything.",
        "It's 1973 all over again, glad we've caught up with the sixties technology at last. Didn't take long.",
        "Some of those launch pictures people took are truly stunning. Thanks for the video Scott!",
        "Is the second half of this video at a lower framerate? Perhaps it's the YouTube app buggy again but my usually work around didn't help it.",
        "Booster shots!",
        "SLS is a smallsat launcher\nChange my mind.",
        "Scott I agree. NASA PR sucks. Its horrible.  They are still operating on the model of \" we don't need cameras for science\".  No, you don't need cameras for all science.  But how on Earth ( pun intended)  do you intend to attract interest in this digital age, if you don't have a 'Wow\" past the launch?  Lets be honest,  no one but us space nerds goes \"Wow\" past the launch. You can play a VR sim that wows you more than NASA footage.   I'm the child of a dad who worked on the Lunar Module, I know how to get excited about space.   They make it tough for the layperson and that's a shame.",
        "It was an awesome launch, I live in north Florida and we could see it 150 miles away. We almost went to bed but I\u2019m glad we all stayed up.",
        "can\u2019t wait for Starship, that\u2019s going to be something I\u2019m sure!",

        "We really are spoilt by SpaceX launch coverage.",
        "Awesome content as always. Thank you.",
        "Kudos to my fellow MPS coworkers for a  flawless performance. It took a tremendous amount effort from our small team to make this happen. You should be very proud.",
        "The whole affair felt like something from the 90s compared to an SpaceX launch. Happy to see it go but, really feel like our tax dollars weren't well spent.",
        "lovely stuff.",
        "How\u2019s the flying going Scott. I wish you the best",
        "Those pictures people took are all absolutely jaw dropping",
        "Speaking of the 5-seg SRBs- I wonder how powerful were they compared to the prototype AJ-260 solid rocket motor test fired in the 60s?",
        "The sound it made when it was lofting itself skyward was incredible, like the air itself was being torn asunder.  Amazing launch.",
        "the white elephant finally flew",
        "THEY PUT A MAMMOTH ENGINE ON A BIG KERBODYNE ORANGE TANK",
        "Over due, over budget, recycled retro technology and NON-Reusable. \n\nArtemis is a government pork barrel project of the WORST kind.",
        "I am a fan of the \"if it ain't broke don't fix it\" mentality, but It's just beyond me that they are still using parts from the 90's that are just lying around, instead of getting manufacturing going to be able to repeat this often.",
        "Good doing NASA but I wish all of government money would have went to Elon Musk and his Starship. We would have been to the Moon by now and planning for a trip to Mars soon!",
        "So dissapointed with nasas filming. This was a highly anticipated launches and NASA doesn't film like spacex. I mean, take the audience into account.",
        "I think he had it right \" Caulk rocket\"",
        "I heard speeds being called out - the greatest was ~16,000 mph.",
        "I've got a slightly technical question about the SLS vs JWST orbital paths that I couldn't find the answer to, can anyone here help me?\nThe JWST on Ariane 5 never made a proper orbit of earth. There was no specific apogee raising burn, instead it directly transfered to Lagrange orbit (I guess that technically counts as raising the apogee to infinity, but you know what I mean). Artemis, however, raised it's apogee, did a half orbit, and then did its TLI burn at that raised apogee, and then started on it's ellipse around Earth and to the Moon. I'm guessing that in both cases it's about making maximum use of the Oberth effect, but I can't work out why those two different situations used completely different methods to do that? Something to do with the launch latitude or launch profile of the two rockets maybe?",
        "Whew, fly save Rusty! I mean... you know. I felt like seeing my grandfather riding his moped at the age of 93 for the last time, while witnessing this spectacle with a little prior knowledge.",
        "What are the twitter references to Shaun the sheep?  Asking for a friend",
        "There were on-board cameras.  They just were not live broadcast to the public.  NASA will likely release them soon.",

        "Massive props to Red Rhetoric!!! Jaw dropping resolution, clarity and sensitivity!! Why isn't NASA using such a setup??",
        "8:45 they launched so late that the night crew is changing the waste baskets.  That woman needs a raise.",
        "Les Johnson, the lead scientist on NEA Scout (and the previous solar sail test flight) is a friend of mine. So jazzed to see this going forward!",

        "Caulk rocket??\nWhen I was at Space Data in the 90s,  they had \"Rocket Tape\" and their literature boasted \"the most thoroughly flight-tested range safety system\" in the business.  Translation: they blew up a lot of sounding rockets! ",

        "As someone who loves space but wasn't alive when Apollo went up, this was a special moment for me. I've been waiting patiently for the day humanity goes back to the moon and we pick back up where we left off in 1972. What a moment. To see Orion + SLS fly together after following the program's progress for over a decade, it's a great feeling. ",
        "This launch brought back memories of the Apollo Soyuz mission from 1975 when I was almost 7 years old just because the size of the rocket.",
        "Any ideas yet what the launch did to the tower, that they have a ban on filming it?\nI do remember the NASA folks and their 'holy cow' moment after the first shuttle launch when they saw how much area away from the launch pad got burned by the boosters. The angle of the shuttle engines was great enough to walk the shuttle out over the ground, to cause those burns.  Dialed back the angles after that.  Compare first and later launch video.  Later videos, shuttle goes mostly vertical.  First flight, you can see very plainly as it walks to the right. ",

        "watched it live last night, absolutely crazy",
        "Great video Scott. Question, can you explain what appear to be blisters and or dents on the lower right area of the 2nd stage at time stamp 6min 53secs please?",
        "This flight profile is similar to how I liked to build my Kerbal rockets.  A sort of \u201cstage and a half to orbit\u201d design where a huge central core supported by drop away cheap boosters would take itself into or almost all the way from pad into orbit and the craft as a second full stage would just pop off with full tanks and go about its spaceflight.  Often this let me recover the vast majority of the main booster cheaply with aerobraking and parachutes.  Eventually with a little RCS and drone core action I got good enough at it to reliably land them back at KSC or just offshore.",

        "We were there for this liftoff it was different! Most of the sound went away from us and we saw the yellow steam from the boosters at first we thought the whole ship was on fire because we couldn\u2019t see the top of the rocket in the dark but the news lady was announcing the speed and height so I knew it was doing fine. Really exciting to see live! Now We can\u2019t wait for Starship, that\u2019s going to be something I\u2019m sure!",
        "One of my earliest, clearest memory was the Apollo 17 night launch, which I watched from the Banana River. It was so bright roosters crowed and fish jumped around in the river thinking it was morning, and it was so bright people could see it as far away as North Carolina. I'd hoped to get over to see this one in person, but couldn't, so I had to settle from watching it over near Tampa, and, unfortunately, I couldn't see a damn thing. I had wondered how bright it was compared to A-17, figuring, \"Must not've been as bright,\" so it's interesting to see that I'm wrong.",

I still have a number of slides I shot of the launch, and also remember very well the sound, vibration, and the pressure.  We were hoping to see the 1st Skylab crew launch the following day on a Saturn IB, but that was delayed until repairs to Skylab could be developed.  Unfortunately, we went home before they launched.

But not a tiniest amount of visible light. You can see this, ot not see it, in the many night launches of the space shuttle. The boosters produce prodigious amounts of flame against the black sky.

But when I turned on the stream once again after the exam, the rocket was sitting on the pad. Just because of the hydrogen leak, the launch was delayed by half an hour...

But, especially Apollo XVII, the only Saturn V launched at night.  SLS may have been brighter due to the SRBs (not a fan of SRBs), but the Saturn V also lit up the night sky like sunrise.",

The SLS broadcast looked a bit 80's in comparison, with the only telemetry being called out verbally every 15 seconds or so, a figure of x miles downrange was all on offer.",

I also understand things like why solar panels have to be folded back in for burns and other such small details through a combination of KSP and also being a car mechanic (understanding stress on components and various other things). It\u2019s so liberating to be able to follow along with something like Artemis and understand what\u2019s going on every step of the way.  I don\u2019t think I could\u2019ve had that without your KSP tutorial videos back in the day. Thank you again!",

One thing you mentioned however sparked my curiosity - If Orion has been developed since 2005 when was its first test flight? If it was any where near 2011 why didn\u2019t they use Orion as an interim spacecraft while Space X and Boeing were developing there\u2019s? It would have been a better alternative than having to rely on the Russians. Thanks - I love your videos. You are the most credible of all of the space commentators! ",

I have had to use a tablet outside in the rain before, and it does not take long for water on the screen to cause the tablet to have problems.  It confuses the water for being touched and it acts like it is being touched everywhere, causing it to either not respond to deliberate touches or go nuts and do lots of random stuff.  I'm sure many smarter people than I have taken this into consideration.  Maybe there is a roll of paper towel stashed under the engineer's seat.  :)",

As an Apollo kid who remembers the Mighty Sat 5, I half expected the SLS to mirror it's agonizing slow lift off. My jaw literally dropped off when that thing left the pad virtually instantly. It was so fast, I now have a little concern for Astronauts who will fly in it. The G-force must be insane.",

As I continue in my life in engineering and thermodynamics it has always felt that we would never return to the Moon; the Apollo missions so, so far in the past.

        "As awesome as the launch was NASA totally missed the boat again. They have a broadcast network that could have been used to show the moon growing closer and the earth fading in the distance. Instead, we get some telemetry and simple graphics, and a few shots of the solar panels and the side of the space craft. With public support waning they could have sparked public interest. They should have hired a cinematographer to help them highlight this great achievement. There could have been cameras on the front, back and inside the spacecraft so the public could watch in awe as all this unfolded. The US spends almost twice as much per year as all other space faring counties put together! The public should get to see what their hard-earned tax dollars are funding. It's as if they are purposely hiding something. I don't like conspiracy theories, but it does beg to question why they would not televise any of the trip outbound to the moon. They say there will be live coverage Monday morning starting at ",
        "My wife and I watched the rocket launch from our front door about 60 miles from the pad. All the clouds between us and the launch were illuminated as if in a sunset, and that was even before the rocket lifted above our neighbor's house. The flame itself was radiant and so incredibly bright, I've never seen one like it.",
        "I honestly thought Artemis 1 was never going to launch. Boy was I wrong. Now we have to wait for December 9th when the Orion spacecraft returns from the Moon. After that, we'll need to wait until 2024, which is when Artemis 2 launches the first crew to do a lunar flyby. Finally, after that we'll need to wait again for 2025 which will be the year Artemis 3 launches. Artemis 3 is supposed to be the mission that will send crew to the Moons surface, and be the first one to do that since Apollo 17.",

Unexpectedly I might add? Not a bad thing but man, wasn't sure if I would ever see something like that in my lifetime, I'm just like holy s*** they actually f**** did it!! It must have triggered something subconsciously from when I was a kid, when I was little the only thing flying was the Space Shuttle and yeah, I was also so happy for NASA everyone involved, and just absolutely Blown Away the Everyday Astronaut team's footage!!
