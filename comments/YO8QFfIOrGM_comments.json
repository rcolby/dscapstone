        "Hi all I just wanted to share something very important. If you don't have a relationship with Jesus Christ as your Lord, here is your sign to turn to Him!   This is the most important thing you'll ever hear in your life. Jesus is coming back soon! God sent His only Begotten Son into the world, that whosoever shall believe on Him shall not perish but have eternal life. Those who do not believe will be condemned. (John 3:16-18). Jesus died for our sins, and to set us free from our sins and condemnation (John 8:36, Acts 13:39). Jesus rose from the the grave 3 days later after His death, defeating death. He now lives forevermore, and seeing we have saving faith in Him,  we too will live eternally with Him! Jesus is the only way to Heaven (John 14:6). Following Him is the best decision to make in life. Though the Christian life isn't a life absent of difficulty, despite any circumstance Jesus gives true peace and fulfillment, a peace and fulfillment this world cannot give (John 14, John 16).",
