        "It's great to hear that Dune - 2 is actually gonna be made, I got the 3D Blu-Ray of Dune and thought it was awesome. I'm a really big \"Dune\" fan, when I was a kid I read ever novel of Dune that was ever published, enjoyed them as much as Steven King novels if not more and that's hard to do! Looking forward to seeing the new Dune when it comes out and hope it's in 3D also, the only real way to see these films! I got a feeling that with the new Avatar being released in 3D this December your gonna see a resurgence of 3D films and HD 3D TVs again hopefully! Then maybe I won't have to order all my 3D movies from overseas! \"Black Widow\" was only released in China in 3D and it was expensive to get a copy but it was worth it!",

        "0:29 Miles Teller and his wife pass by in the background lol. Austin looked in that direction twice before this, prepared to greet them had they looked. \n\nMiles was in a big movie that made a lot of money but Austin has all the spotlights on him, being interviewed, attending roundtables and being asked about Oscar buzz, even though he got less pay for Elvis. That\u2019s why sometimes it\u2019s okay to get paid less for a bigger opportunity that will put you on the map. Although, in this case it was just destiny and beyond their own choosing. Man, it must have stung Miles a bit to lose the Elvis part and now see Austin here.",
        "He looks so good \ufe0f",
        "A win would be great. He doesn\u2019t get a better opportunity than this for sure but he is still very young and everyone (including myself) is saying that Fraser will win this year but what would the Oscar\u2019s be without a little controversy?

        "A mix of Paul Newman and Brad Pit",
        "Omg",
        "HE HAS A BEARD NOW?",
        "I\u2019ve watched the Denis Dune over and over. I cannot get enough of the whole epic artistry of it. Cannot wait for 2! \nThis guy in the Dune 1984 Sting role fits perfectly. He has the \u201clook at me, I\u2019m gorgeous\u201d  expression to a needle point.

        "He has that 90s Hollywood glamour, I just love him",
        "Didn\u2019t this guy make out with Timothees ex while they were together? Gonna be awkward but I\u2019m sure Timothee and Austin will be adult about it.",
        "perfect casting for fyed ratha",
        "How\u2019s this\u2026.? His mama knows him\u2026",

        "I really hope we get to see the imperial planet Kaitain in Dune part 2!\nThe corrino adopted homeworld has always  fascinated me, maybe because its not explored that much in the original novels.\nBut what we do know about it makes it sound amazing, obviously its the seat of government but its described as a utopia with vast cities with dream like buildings, statues and waterfalls and tree lined boulevards that are so majestic and staggeringly amazing \"a person could stare for hours\"."
