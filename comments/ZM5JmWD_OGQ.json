I thought he was hilarious and insane at PvP, so when I heard that he was going to be in a tournament with some of my favorite and biggest Minecraft creators, I instantly tuned in knowing that he was gonna be a force to reckon with. Little did I know that his previously small audience would multiply and his dream of 10 million subs would come true. I enjoyed every second of watching Technos channel grow. I always kept up with his content, even though admittedly I grew up and stopped watching as much minecraft content as I used to. However, Technos content always reminded me of watching his videos late at night, laughing my ass off at his witty jokes and dry humor. His jokes and mannerisms were more universal, and even as I became more mature his banter would always strike a chord with me.", "I'm so sorry you didn't win! They honestly fooled me too.
