        "Damn, straight fire!!",
        "This sh!t hard!",
        "I like how this videos depicts his isolation and him avoiding social interaction. He understands that solitude is healthier for his spirit in the long run but it's clearly taking a bigger toll on him than he expected.\n\nHe clearly loves the freedom being alone gives him, but still craves community. This is symbolised by the phone or a knock that LITERALLY snaps him out of his groove. As if social relations disturb his peace which is hella relatable.",

        "He speaks about grieving , talking to the ones we lost  , how angry it makes you in the inside , dealing with the shadow version of yourself , and staying focused on the things you need rather than what you want and the battle of staying against his shadow , when he talks on the phone he\u2019s talking to someone who can\u2019t answer back. Rich soul attracts money, he\u2019s speaking to other African Americans to load up with knowledge and protection.",

Basically nobody is home . I love it .  the phone is not connected cause he feels disconnected. Nobody is listening to him when he speak . They do their own thing . So he fasting from the toxic ppl. \u201c I pray to god she knows them Cabo trips don\u2019t last forever \u201c he wrote this before a girl was killed in Cabo by her \u201c friends\u201d . Kendrick is so intuitive. Not saying he knew that would happen. But the fact that he knows how the ppl in this world can kill you. Even those close to you.",

        "Whoa!! The symbolism in this video was amazing. The colors. Red (sinner/deviant) to White (enlightened/cleansed). The choice of timing. Night to day. It seems as if Kendrick was really \"fasting\" from something. The life of lust, pride, ego, and temptation? (Based on the theme of the album) To now focus on things that make him feel like a better person? Ex. being a father, abstaining from adultery, etc. Right when he gets to that cleansed, bright, and wonderful stage of breakthrough where he was wearing white and freeing himself from the darkness the phone rings again. Symbolic of all of our vices, and how it's able to turn into a cyclical battle. Right when you're ready to change you get sucked back in.. or at least tempted to. Anyways, I say all that to say that I enjoyed the visual aspect of this music video a lot! ",
