I feel like Kevin was actually planning on taking over his company after he get diluted from new investors. Then maybe added it, combine it with his other wine business?", "I've seen Mark do this 2-3 times when he thinks somebody decent is getting hosed.  Honestly, even if the deal never went through it saved this young man from having to make such a huge decision on the spot.  He can get 100K for 50% anywhere, that wasn't special.", "That was a blast lets go mark i love ot exactly what had to happen exactly haha\nI feel like u should give it everything u got and want to do so they can actually evaluate it feels like if they see future and see you doing it and beeing behind it they go in especially mark and sometimes even lori", "Kevin had too much wine.
