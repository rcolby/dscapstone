        "What Ronaldo did for MU last season was unbelievable, MU should be ashamed.",
        "imagine treating ronaldo like this !!!!!",
        "How can he feel like he's being forced out the club when these times he's the 1 that wanted to leave???",
        "Cooked himself",
        "Look I love ronaldo but his got to go like we got to rebuild this club no matter , no matter how big he may seem I feel like we do play better without him , his not in his prime anymore I'm looking forward to seeing him in the world  cup I'm Portuguese myself and I hope he does well and good luck to his future",
        "Desperation, No one with half a thought process would desire Ronaldo at the Club every week",
        "He sounds just like Rangnick tbh",
        "He is not the player he was...he's had an incredible career and  his team mates at man utd have long since retired...he did incredibly well to play for so long...Real Madrid or no other team are going to be interested in you it's now over Cristiano time to realize it",
        "I honestly believe that if he was getting goals, then he'd be starting games and wouldn't have any issues/complaints.\n\nHe's not playing regularly because he's not getting the goals when United need them",
        "Yet to where? Because no one wants him.",
        "He wasn\u2019t ill. He pretended that to not get hurt in the last 2 games before World Cup.",
        "He deserves more",
        "He was the first to betray us when he left for Madrid",
        "It's best that Ronaldo leaves Manchester United. It's a sad way to end this way since returning last season when Manchester United are in complete shambles. No point of keeping a player that causes nothing but chaos to the squad.",
        "It\u2019s the sporting world who have a lot to answer. \n\nStop paying huge wages for these pre Madonna\u2019s then maybe they might come down from their pedestals of \u201cI\u2019m bigger than the club/team and it\u2019s my way or no way\u201d attitude.",
        "Sooner your gone the better Ronaldo",
        "Lets see what Roy Keane and Ferdinand has to say about this",
        "No player is bigger than the club, shouldn't be disrespecting players, coaches, etc - that's an unfortunate end to his Manchester United career\nAlways love you Cristiano, but this is out of line, trying to force himself out of the club earlier this season - kept to be in plans, walked off the pitch and didn't show up to games more than once, and when he's played we've been below average, what a decline, what a sad way to end his relationship with a lot of fans",
        "CR7's ManU legacy is over!! Dead!! The end!! He ruined it himself!!",
        "Dude skips pre season, has his agent offer him to several champions League clubs, walks out of a pre season friendly (manager publicly backed him) refuses to come in as a sub and then leaves the stadium.. sorry but he has a strange idea what respect is",
        "When you unable to outgrow the man child in you. Let's blame everybody else for your own failure.",
        "Sadly, as much as I'd like to believe he's said this for the benefit of the fans and for the good of the club, I doubt he would've said anything if he wasn't pushing for his release and the timing of this interview tells me all I need to know.",
        "Never forget that Ronaldo plays for Ronaldo, and Ten Hag knows it.",
        "He is not respecting himself, so he doesn't deserve the respect. Man u is better than him Ronaldo is too rude let him work on himself",
        "Bye CR7 and welcome Garnacho! It's business Ron business ",
        "Great players don't get forced out of clubs!",
        "About time",
        "I knew one day he`ll spill the beans and here we Go",
        "Ronaldo betrayed himself when he refused to join the team for preseason, the coaches tried all he could to keep him but he continued wanting out and being indiscipline, now he wants the coach to respect him when he disrespected the coach in the first place and the team at large",
        "People calling Ronaldo \"a hero\" for \"exposing\" man united are just idiots.\n\nHe doesn't care about the club anymore, doesn't care about the fans or outdated facilities or having the same kitchen stuff for 17 years. He just wants leave on a free transfer because no one wants to pay for him.",
        "He IS being forced out.  Never should have been brought back.  He's an aging superstar well past his prime.  Overpaid, overhyped, and with an ego that simply doesn't allow him to accept the obvious... he's not the player he once was.  And based on this reporting, he's played his last match for the club.  I'm hesitant to say it didn't have to end this way, but it did.",
        "I wish he goes to city or Chelsea or Liverpool n he revisits old Trafford under a different EPL team",
        "Ronaldo will be joining LA galaxy,I don't see any top European team going for him,so it's safe to say his European football is over.",
        "Messi could never",
        "Funny how he would have won the epl with city if he didn\u2019t answer that fergie call",
        "We were saying bad about him and he is struggling there so it\u2019s hard for him he is big player no doubt ",
        "Ronaldo spitting facts",
        "This was maybe the last interview as a football player in an international top club...",
        "Happy new year Ronaldo! Fresh start ... question is where will he go? MLS..? Or back home to Sporting Lisbon?",
        "Maybe he will go back to Sporting Lisbon ",
        "I love Ronaldo with all my heart it's such a shame its come to this , he will always be remembered as a legend for United",
        "Of course they are trying to get you out look at this madness ",
        "Ronaldo...snake",
        "The legacy is gone. Goodbye and good luck.",
        "This interview can be taken as a fatewell match for ronaldo. From now on no club would ever sign him.",
        "Taxi for Ronaldo.",
        "Listen to this guy talk is like pulling teeth. It's like watching someone experiencing a Stroke.",
        "He is the GOAT, he wants the best of the best from his club but cannot fulfilled his needs",
        "Ralph Ragnick said United needed a heart surgery in his assessment of the situation and how the club is ran, the truth is we have no picture of how damaged this club is. Jose Maurinho had words, Pogba was sent in as a quarterback with no runners or shield yet was expected to work magic tricks, we dance to the mediocracy of Ol\u00e8, he should have never been made permanent, another indication of a lack of a sound plan, just vibez",
        "this is for sure the last time we see him",
        "Ronaldo betray manutd by looking at another UCL club in the summer",
        "Whilst Ronaldo is right about the state of the club and how it\u2019s run most of what he talked about was stuff that was already known about and talked about. As for his comment about Ten Hag disrespecting him\u2026. He did not need to say that on a public medium. That is definitely what will prompt Man U to sell him but then Ronaldo has already shown several signs he wants out of Man U. ",
        "When You talk about Drama queen \nWhen You talk about Ego \nYou mean CR7",
        "You can.Force Ronaldo out of the Club now but if anyone in football is know to Haunt clubs it's Ronaldo \n\nThey will regret it",
        "Prime example of \u201c never take back your ex\u201d.",
        "He is business, what does he think he is accountants run Manchester",
        "Mi nimshabiki wake mkubwa lakini ina bid angalie umri saivi muda wa kuwaachia all young prayer for pafomas ganacho antony rashford martial suport to team man utd now",
        "Idk why anyone who puts in a transfer request during preseason who feel betrayed, says another about the man ",
        "There is a reason Legends bow out when the ovation is loudest. CR7 should realize that this interview will do more harm to his reputation than good. This will also definitely put undue scrutiny on the Portuguese national team and if his performance there is below his known standards, he will feel the heat for years to come. Nobody is bigger than the club. NOBODY!!!",
        "Let\u2019s be honest here, I\u2019m a Ronaldo fan, will always be, but I\u2019m a arsenal supporter, nobody electrified the epl like he did, but he is past his prime, but he is not wrong here, bad board, bad owners and bad managers, eth I\u2019m not sure yet, it\u2019s better for him to leave, have a good World Cup and retire ",
        "Ronaldo can\u2019t face the fact he isn\u2019t very good anymore. Even Rashford is clear of him.",
        "What about the disrespect when he refused to come on and walked out. If you're a United fan you cannot defend him unfortunately. The club is always bigger than the players.",
        "I hope that Christian is able to work things out so he doesn't have to leave. If he doesn't want to go then why is he being forced to leave? I don't follow these stories much, so forgive me for asking because I don't know what is going on.",
        "Now iam just not United fan !!!!!",
        "He has no right to BS about ETH because he has been poor this season but yes his comments on how the club has been run is spot on.",
        "I\u2019m gonna be real he\u2019s an egomaniac. He was the one forcing the move earlier this year, and now he blames the management that they want him out. He\u2019s finished. Still can\u2019t wait to see him score a 90+6 minute goal with Trabzonspor in the conference league tho.",
        "Why are there people talking in the background",
        "They are not trying that hard to get him out, they could have let him go in the summer",
        "Weirdly I believe him. He\u2019s an icon of the game, so Manchester United should really get him involved more often.",
        "Oh Ronaldo..it\u2019s true since SAF left, I even stopped watching football. Then I heard you coming back and I fell in love again with the game. Sad to see this ending like this. All the best...Not stopping to watch football this time though..",
        "Ronaldo OUT now. Sick to death of him. Hes the head clown in is own circus",
        "He needs to go cause we lose when he plays",
        "Force him out? Didn't he try and leave to any club in the champions League..... A 37 year old truly needs to grow up and accept his downfall",
        "If he said , he wanted to leave, then he should be happy that he\u2019s being forced out d door. No bad feelings. This guy has put d team thru he\u2019ll with his behaviour on d pitch. He\u2019s done very well for d team in d past but this season must be his swan song. Basically he doesn\u2019t fit into this new system which has seen d team doing well. It\u2019s better for d team to do well than just one player scoring 20 goals but d team finishing in 6th. That\u2019s too bad for d team.let him go now or force him out! ",
        "Some of us will always be by your side, Cristiano Ronaldo.",
        "Ummm if last season \"Cristiano Ronaldo\" would not be top score player them today's Manchester United would be out of <Premier league >.  Even messi was terrible in his time. You can't stop ronaldo to give his opinion.",
        "I don't necessarily like Arsenal, but at least they let Auba go for free when the situation became untenable. \n\nWhat United did, keeping CR7 over the summer and not let him go, and then not giving him minutes, is really unprofessional. Shame.",
        "United were doing so much better without Ronaldo, better for him and the club to part ways ASAP",
        "playing victim, not realized he's finished",
        "He should go to a better club and then destroy Erick ten  we know how ronaldo can do it ",
        "Which one do we take now, before he said the club doesn\u2019t want him to leave now everybody is forcing him out even last season",
        "\"EtH disrespect Ronaldo\" <- HOW??",
        "Bro who tf cares ",
        "People scoffed and laughed at Mourinho when he spoke about how poorly the club is run and now everyone admits he was right. \n\nPeople are scoffing and laughing at Ronaldo but in a few years time people will again be admitting he was right.",
        "Big thanks to Ed Woodward.",
        "cr7 big cry baby. his form is down and he can't do anything rite",
        "as an old united fan, i am 100% backing Ten hag on this! I never want to see you in the red shirt again cr7. please leave!",
        "acting like such a child, i know hes competitive but if you want to play every week then go to the MLS or a lower team. Just face it hes just not got the fitness to keep up with top level football anymore. what a petulant man, hes probably got the playing ability to move in a deeper role and learn to be more of a playmaker but his ego wont let him, thats why Messi is such a more complete player. It shows me some players play for the love of football but i guess ronaldo plays for his ego happy for to never see him in the premier league",
        "I like how indoctrinated the average person is, how gullible and naive they are. Organisations can and do disrespect individuals all the time and no one calls it out. Ronaldo has been shaded and disrespected by loads of British sports media unfairly for ages now and it's because he represents something that the media execs aren't for. So yes he has been severely disrespected at a club that is run worse than any football fan could imagine before.",
        "Good bye ronaldo clubs always bigger than any player",
        "Ronaldo might be class but nobody's bigger than the club",
        "He should sign other club, he can still goal a lot...compare to young players",
        "Ronaldo thinks the whole world revolves around him. Get him out of the club",
        "He's getting paid too much money that could be split between a few players. Lov CR7 the GOAT, he must just leave and find peace!",
        "As a Liverpool fan I\u2019ve ordered more popcorn for Wednesday & Thursday evening.",
        "As Man United fan I feel betrayed as Ronaldo want to leave the club before the season starts, and we lost almost every game when he\u2019s in the starting squad",
        "You mean the man who was trying to force a move away two months ago is being forced out? Funny how he says this right as the season takes a break until pretty much January where no doubt he\u2019ll try and force a move again. If I were edh I would keep him in the reserves until his contract expired for this",
        "Oh Ronnie Ronnie.... When will these players regardless of stature learn that no player is bigger than the club.\nCR7 was going off the boil and he can't blame ten hag in switching play... But Cristiano assumes he gets to play every game because of who he is.... You're still a great player but you're older now and your experience is just as vital behind the scenes than on the pitch, it's a shame that you have started to speak publicly about your emotions and biting the hand that feeds you.",
        "he betrayed himself by failing to impress the manager and having that superiority ideology because he feels he is a club legend. i am glad that ten hag is getting reed of this drama queen.",
        "Respect for Ronaldo means playing him day in day out with the team losing and finishing outside champions league. They should not give him what he wants. They should suspend him until his contract expires.",
        "Maybe he need the whole world playing around him, but this is a team game, not a player game.",
        "Ronaldo has failed to realise that he\u2019s getting old and the coach has it own vision and him (Ronaldo) is a boden to ETH plan Cus of his age.      I\u2019m his biggest fans but he should tell his self the truths. Trying to be the best forever is not a good thing.",
        "Sad to see it end like this. I will never forget what he did for the club. Watching that freekick live against Portsmouth will always have a place in my heart. Farewell Ronny.",
        "In my opinion he has not be given enough game time to prove he can still do it at his age, one last season starting regular up top I think the interview with pierce wouldn\u2019t of happened",
        "he wanted to leave in the summer and he feels betrayed now...lmao",
        "All I know is if Pogba was moving like this, man they would be calling him to be burned on the spot like he is a witch. Keep the same energy guys\u2026\u2026",
        "Biggest mistake he made was goin bk it never usually works out.",
        "Let\u2019s be honest this is the first time he said something about anyone. Shows how bad united is at the moment",
        "He is almost 38 years old and you can already see the age catching up to him in this sport. This happens to every footballer, no shame in that. There is no way a manager will play an almost 38y old week in week out. United are rebuilding and Ronaldo is clearly not part of it. The manager didn't disrespect Ronaldo at all, never said a bad thing about him.",
        "Truth is: penaldo thought fergie time is still at man u",
        "It\u2019s Over He\u2019s Leaving ",
        "Lets not turn a blind eye to the truth...his being forced out,its clear as daylight",
        "Ten Haag has done a good job. Ronaldo is over the hill and can't handle it.",
        "Cr7 for liverpool",
        "Shame. What the current United Regime are doing to him are beyond words.",
        "MUFC have destroyed some talented players\u2019 careers over the past 5 years. No vision, no long term plan at all.",
        "now repeat it w/out crying ",
        "The truth is CR7 refuses to accept that he can't play well anymore as he used to, he should understand that he is grown to play competitively.",
        "The way Chelsea are playing at present I would take Ronaldo in January ,might improve our goals scored.",
        "He's obviously made up his mind and it's time to let it rip. Glad he's doing it now to clear the air and to be fully concentrated for the world cup. I hope he and portugal win the WC. CR7 is a legend and nobody will remember the gouda head in 5 years.",
        "Where's Ronny Rolls Royce's Johnny Cochrane's now ?",
        "If Piers is involved, we surely have to believe without question",
        "What a nice role model he is for thousands of kids",
        "Nobody betrayed him he can never be bigger than Manchester united, are can stand to lose game just because we want to please Ronaldo, we have be giving him game time in front of millions fans it's quite clear that he is old and he can't perform anymore, we have a lot of young relented youths who can do the job better, we thank him for his efforts in the club during his staying at Manchester united, thinks has changed now and he should understand better.",
        "What nonsense, disrespectful....you don't own the football club Christiano and if you don't like what's  going there, then leave...and pouring your heart out to Piers Morgan, that's not very clever!",
        "Who would want someone at the club that goes on like Ronaldo does.",
        "This dude reading it out is struggling\u2026 ",
        "If you compare him to similar players that came back to their old club drogba Henry they both played limited minutes as a sub",
        "Gone in January and rightly so for both parties, no need for this crap before he goes. He\u2019s a great player that sadly isn\u2019t deadly enough anymore to compete with the big clubs. Lots of others also need to go.",
        "So then bets are open who's the next near 40 year old utd is gonna bring in",
        "There was a lot of turmoil in Manchester United even before CR7 got there. Do not blame Ronaldo for forcing his exit now",
        "Ronaldo is only making it harder for himself. He should leave with respect and keep his legacy.",
        "I believe there are those who seek to damage his reputation for their own gain. Ten hag flexing his muscles in a way to get control of the rudderless ship from the minute he arrived it was clear he wanted and needed CR7 out, SO WHY did they not let him go in the summer? I get the fact he can be a baby at times but hell given what they have there he is by far their best player, given the support and opportunity from those around him he would have continued to do just that. Such a shame this is the ending of his story at UTD, could have been so much more. This is from a Liverpool fan as well not a CR7 fan boy but a fan of world class players where ever they may have played. Move on CR7 find your strength and carry on else where.",
        "Wait until Gary and Jamie open their mouths and start criticising him yet they are one of those who have been waiting for him to speak his side",
        "Bring him to Arsenal. He\u2019ll turn Martinelli into a monster.",
        "Problem I have with this as a united fan. Ronaldo made it clear he wanted to leave. No one wanted him and now united are trying to force him out? Ten Haag had to play a different way which is was not part of",
        "He'll definitely not be playing for United ever again now !!",
        "His big mistake was to go out Real Madrid the way he did!!!",
        "I would force him out to. The money he is being paid can easily pay 4-5 players",
        "won\u2019t be missed\u2026",
        "Dont cry for me Argentina the truth is I never left you...",
        "Ronaldo will end his career on a high note but not with Man united.\nAll the best CR7.",
        "He\u2019s doing what most of Man Utd fans has been asking for years, which is for someone to come out of what is happening inside closed doors because there are definitely many terrible things happening. For all the slander he said about the club which was direct attack to the board, I agree with almost everything or even everything.",
        "I like the part when he said if u want to begin with me, TS ok..please man utd, include Rashford,Maguire,shaw and Phil Jones on that list",
        "He would be a decent stand in for Mitrovic",
        "He is set to sign for Liverpool in January",
        "Mu forcefully brought back Ronaldo to club and for that he saved it ass but the new boss constantly benched him ,u have to Handel legend like him and a star performer for ur club last season",
        "Feeling for Ronaldo the best player, his work ethics are unbelievable",
        "Come do a season in the MLS!  Zlatan and Rooney were Gods!",
        "If you in the lime light don\u2019t go talk to piers",
        "Not sure if people realise the interview would have taken place a week to 2-3 weeks back after he clearly stated he was 'To reveal all' through a social post made a few months ago. Clearly many of the criticism thats come his way was significant after recent events, which shows a cemented stance behind Cristiano's perspective on the situation of him being pushed out of the club and being treated unfairly - which in my opinion seems to have been MU Executive and Coaches agenda from the beginning of the season.",
        "No one can escape the cruel hands of time, not Ronaldo nor Messi. Last season, he was great. Scored 20+ for United. But this season, he's been abysmal and ETH has been fair to him. \nI think it's a case of him unable to come to terms with reality. He could have gracefully retired but he is Cristiano Ronaldo, he'd rather go down with the ship than wave a white flag.",
        "Bruh this video is just the guy repeating 10x of what Ronaldo said. Could have read it myself...",
        "the only people who are betrayed here are the fans.",
        "It is easy to see Ten Hag wants Ronaldo to leave. He  doesn't give him more chances, to play, he  substitutes him at the last few minutes of the games. He wants people to think that Manchester United will win when Ronaldo is not playing and vise versa.\nBest luck Ronaldo. You deserve happiness.",
        "Where is the audio",
        "When ronaldo does great in quata dont call it a comeback",
        "He's only making excuses. I don't believe a word he says",
        "finished player ",
        "Ronaldo: \"How can I cover the fact I'm just not as good anymore and that's why I don't get games?\"\nAlso Ronaldo: \"I know, I'll go on Piers Morgan and say I'm being disrespected\"\n\nClass act!",
        "He wants to leave then he doesn't  just piss off they play better without you anyway",
        "Oooohhhh crash and burn, the club is partly to blame, but unfortunately we are not 22 forever, he will always be a legend, and he has had a massive career, but it comes that time when it's done, sorry Ronaldo we will miss you.",
        "Ronaldo shares a similar aura of Mourinho's attitude and fans. They both always complain, they both always blame people other than them and they both have sets of fans that are completely blind and out of their depths who defends them blindly. The guy is a legend just like Mourinho, but when you lose it you lose it, no need to sugar coat it and say otherwise. Most probably the guys who defend him haven't seen his early career and mostly highlights.",
        "No one is or should be bigger than the club. Don't let the door hit you on your way out.",
        "This guy is the problem in Manchester United he should go",
        "He's on to much money.",
        "He's an extremely selfish 'has-been'.\nAway!!!",
        "Man United hierarchy should be held accountable, in bringing CR7 to OT only to ensure that he doesn't land up at Etihad !! He shud have been at OT when he quit Madrid, not now. Despite his GOATness, he is known to be egotistical and well, none of United's managers were 10% of SAF's calibre and stature. This was bound to happen. Ronaldo too should have introspected what he did in past few months to warrant a prima donna status. Sad to see this day !!",
        "Me parece genial que Cristiano lo haya soltado (no lo trataron bien desde que llego, y no hubo empatia, buen trato y humanidad en el tratamiento hacia el, tras el fallecimiento de su hijo, y solo salia en los medios que porque no participo de la pretemporada [ejm: Sky Sports, Espn UK, etc] no es parte del plantel ni tomado en consideraci\u00f3n, cuando se sabia que lo pidio por un tema de salud de su hija) y asi como es dificil saber sobre el Barza, Messi en lo negativo y demas temas en Latinoamerica, con \u00e9l es lo mismo, solo unos cuantos ex compa\u00f1eros (Rio Ferdinand, si mas no recuerdo, fue de los pocos que explic\u00f3 el porqu\u00e9). La verdad el merece m\u00e1s, pero as\u00ed como esto \u00e9l debe valorar a ex compa\u00f1eros como Karim, y felicitarlo pero creo no est\u00e1 en un buen momento an\u00edmico ni mental, pero debe darse un espacio para ello y valorar a quienes lo valoran ",
        "He should take revenge and join their rivals like Man City, Liverpool or Chelsea for free.",
        "Instead of just saying that there are videos to prove his performance has not changed from when he took someone's place till now and thank them for not for picking him then although he was not talking to them about anything",
        "I will not surprised if I see his contract terminated within this week.",
        "Man U be treated C Ronaldo like he was you amateur football player the lack of disrespect when Messi get treated like a Boss in PSG",
        "How can Ten Hag disrespect someone who was your highest scorer last season ",
        "Manchester United has not been the same since Ferguson left. Clearly they\u2019re board doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s doing. Even Jose Mourinho joked about winning a Trophy at Man U, but there is some truth to jokes.",
        "This situation with Ronaldo and Man U is now untenable, with Ronaldo's  voluntary interview with the media.",
        "No player will be like ronaldo and messi and our legend pele",

        "CR7 think he is too big for any club. That's why other clubs refused his service. This is the end of CR7. The world Cup is his last venue. See if he respect his Portugal coach. Eric 10 Hag is only focusing on rebuilding the club and winning next game. So CR7 thinking and Eric are miles apart. Eric don't live in history. Eric dwell in the present day and plan for the future, not in the past.",
        "Man Utd must decide what to do with him.  \nArsenal had a problem in Aubameyang. And I understand that Ronaldo is miles better than him and a much bigger star but now they must let him go and build the future without him. United are good without him, it\u2019s not beautiful football but you can still pull off a win. Get him off the wage bill and ETH will send a message to the team that no one is bigger than the club.",
        "he was a great player but sometimes you have to admit age is catching up with you. and man u have to look to the future with younger players",
        "I have been a united fan since the 90s.  I have nothing but respect and gratitude for Ronaldo.  Anyone could see something has been wrong with him this season watching him on the pitch.  I figured it was just a combination of losing a child and a lack of minutes to get his form back.  Turns out there was even more eating at him.  It is such a shame to see the state man u is in and an even bigger shame to see how a club legend has been treated.  Best of luck to Ronaldo in the future where ever he might go.",

        "Wait for the full disclosure on Thursday and Friday",
        "His come back was  wrong from day 1.\nUnited never need a player with the ego he has. Everything  is always about him, and  loves to complain like a baby.\nFrom my point  of view even in his best year at Manchester(last season) his influence wasn't good on the young players.most of them lost thier confidence in front of goal, you've got to pass every ball  to him , his body language wasn't good when they go for  themselves. He ended up the best player of the season united as a team was terrible yet.",

        "For another words, the Americans owners converted Man United in a third class club, because they don't know nothing about football, perhaps baseball, since CR7 left the club they won zero Champions and the club are fighting for the biggest ambition in the Premier League, be fourth,, instead  CR7 won more four Champions and played in top teams with highlevel of excellence, so when he came back is like to return to the past that never came, facts.",

I can almost guarantee since Messi is going to Inter Miami next season, Ronaldo will end up playing in the states too. It's almost a guarantee. And of course it's never Ronaldo's fault, he ruined the dynamics at Juventus and now he's ruined the dynamics at Man Utd. I mean before he came along Juventus were winning everything in sight in Italy, Man Utd finished 3rd.",

He'd still able to compete....how many times did he rescued us from almost losing to those games from the last season....hes the one that we won to those last minute of the games.... the Fact is CRISTIANO RONALDO is not the problem for all this seasons....the true problems who brought downfall to our Club are, the boards, directors, the top management, the fans who refused to blame the true victim instead blaming the One's who give all the best trying to help this club to reach its Best again ....After Sir Alex Retired this Club is instantly LOST!!....The truth is After the Sir Alex Retired....the only one the only manager who brought Manchester United better was Jose Mourinho....and the Fans the management still blame that guy who gave all his best for this club who let us win European Cup, F.A Cup and League Cup....hes the only guy that almost bring back Manchester United to its true level....but still the fans dont appreciate what he had done.... instead blaming the true guy again and let him get sacked....just like this happening to Ronaldo... The fans and all others who put blame on Ronaldo are the fools again...im so happy for Ronaldo finally Understand the Situation he's been put on....he deserves to be RESPECT....Sadly but the Fact is with these trash players with these negative surroundings, he'll never ever achieve trophies or anything....We don't deserve Ronaldo's Hardwork, Winning Mentality the true mindset that all player's must have ...but sadly that most of our players dont have....",

After walking down the tunnel early, refusing to come onto the pitch at times, etc. He's not a team player and hasn't earned the respect he wants this season. He thinks everyone should auto-respect him because he's one of the GOATs, but it doesn't work like that does it? He can take his complaining, dramatic self far away from Man U, thank you very much.",

        "As a huge fan to CR7, I really don't understand his mindset. His return to ManU was a fairy tail, and could have been ManU's biggest legend. Last summer, he decided to chase Champions league, and that's fine. But unfortunately, no team wants him, and he lost all his leverage to ETH. More sadly, he's going downhill like a rocket this season. Instead of accepting the fact, he chose to blame everyone except himself.",

        "I'm a big Utd fan and a fan of Ronaldo but I see him doing this only for himself. No player wants a team mate who is always sulking when you do not give them the ball. He is also now too old to play the kind of game Ten Hag wants. No individual player can be bigger than Utd, maybe he should try Sporting !!",

        "If he was doing it on the pitch this season then it would throw weight behind his statement but he was a great player not anymore. He wanted out if the club well you just got it.",
        "  This is how spoiled bratts speak. He failed the leadership test. He didn't want to do the pre-season. And what he is saying makes absolutely no sense. The club is on the right path under Erik Ten Hag we can all see that. I have always questioned his leadership skills even at Madrid. Contrary to what he thinks he wouldn't have played much at City nor Liverpool.",
        "Romans 3:23 states: \"For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;\". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 \"But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.\". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: \"Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\". Romans 10:13 states \"For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.\". ",

Half the stuff he said about the owners and Ragnick are what Utd fans have been banging on about for years. Now ronaldo openly says it and Utd fans are fuming. If Ronaldo is feeling disrespected by ten hag there\u2019s a reason. Don\u2019t blindly side with ten hag and hate Ronaldo. There\u2019s more to this than the camera shows.

Add to that him being unavailable for pre-season as he tried to engineer a move to a Champions League club to boost his own position as leading goal=scorer.  Sad but CR7 has played for himself for a little too long.  Let's remember his greatness and forget his last disappointing half season.",
        "He would've gone to ANY champions league club that offered him what he wanted in the summer, but everyone who could afford him knew it would not be worth having such a baby at their club. Look at how United have turned it around without him. This seems like a desperate move, because he knows he won't play at United anymore, and he needs to try and make other teams believe it's not his fault. Unless is he willing to take gigantic paycut, he is not going anywhere in January",

If he means loyal is by giving all the chances, all the minute play and wait for him to give result than it makes me wonder whether he is a pro footballer or not.
