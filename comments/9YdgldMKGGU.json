More than anything No Regrets was a resounding success. My support is unconditional for YD, not to mention that their songs reach my soul and motivate me to make a better life and not settle for less. And why not look for a life with better economic well-being, thanks to him and all the artists I mentioned before because they show me that anything is possible.
