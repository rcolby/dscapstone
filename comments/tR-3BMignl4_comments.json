        "To get the best tea infused hot water the method is to get the most infusion in the lest amount  of time possible and that can be done by vibrating the tea bag at the surface of the water (leaving half of the tea bag out of the water) in a vertical motion which creates some what of a negative pressure pulling the teafushion downwards ,,,,, thats if your using tea bags",

Water and tea is how I have had it and that is fine.  An addition of milk would seem to just make it less enjoyable.",

        "As a British person I think I know why tea from a teapots colder, usually when you drink tea from a teapot you are at a cafe or a public place and you want to drink it straight away while at home when you pour straight to the cup it\u2019s because your on the sofa watching tv or chatting to people coming over so you\u2019re drinking it less / ignoring it for a while until there\u2019s a break in conversation",

They boil the tea in a pot with the leaves, sometimes use jaggery goor (unrefined cane sugar with molasses etc) instead of sugar and use milk powder a lot rather than milk. Tastes amazing.

Because I'm a tea addict, I decided to look at the chemical reaction between the polyphenols in tea leaves and calcium carbonate in hard water that form a yucky, scummy skin on the top of your tea if you leave it too long.

        "Mat is right, the best amount of milk is no milk! I mean, it's nice with chai or other teas that have appropriate blends of other ingredients, but milk takes away a lot of the tea's own flavour, or downright ruins it if the tea isn't meant to be drunk with milk. Be mindful of the type of tea you drink before ruining it with dairy! Always taste your tea without any additions first. This has been a PSA.",

        "Iroh after reading the title: your tea in nothing but hot leaf juice!\n\nAlso, I wanna say that tea originated in China. Legend says that an emperor and his servant were under a tree. The servant was boiling water and a leaf fell in the water. The emperor, who was an herbalist, tried the concoction and thus tea was born. I did a project about how tea became an important part of British culture and it\u2019s really interesting. I forgot some of it, but I think a duchess from Portugal grew up having tea as the perfected drink and others drank tea from her influence. I grew up drinking chai, but without the spices or masala. We boil water and add the tea leaves and milk (I don\u2019t brew the tea so idk the order) and then when the tea is a tan-ish color with a layer of milk cream on top, we pour it into mugs and add sugar (brown to be specific). Then we eat it with a biscuit called cake rusk (rusk is pronounced without the k, so it\u2019s rus). I plan on trying many more recipes of tea to try and see my taste preferences since this is the tea I drank growing up and I like to experience new things. The tea project made me want to try other variations.",

        "This works with any mugs I have but try it at your own risk, my tea goes a little like this:\n\n-Fill the mug with hot water from a kettle almost to the top.\n-When putting in a teabag it should raise the water level right to the brim.",
        "If you steeped the tea in the mug during the milk before vs after experiment, the difference is likely from the boiling water cooking the milk in the \"before\" cup, making it taste off. It likely wouldn't make a difference if you steeped the tea in a teapot instead, then poured it into a cup with milk at the bottom.",

        "mat, the western way to brew tea is too thick and doesnt leave any room of other flavour other then catechin (the bitter) flavour in the cup of tea and plus adding milk to the tea will cover the natural tea flavor. I suggest a chinese method to brew tea using gaiwan, those step brew tea very thin even more into watery (very dilute) but in that way it's more pleasant to the tongue",
        "Loose leaf is the best way to go. It can also be used twice so it lasts longer.",

        "Lol, here is one you don't seem to have thought of: \nI brew it in my COFFEE MAKER (well, it used to be my dad's coffee maker before he passed away in 2013- but I am allergic to coffee, so I invented a reason to use it) when I plan to have more than 1 cup a day.  ",
        "Ah, the real reason for FoodTheory... Writing food off as a business expense. MatPat is amazing",

Every time she\u2019s in a Theorist video she\u2019s always insightful and very funny. I\u2019ve seen YouTubers bring their spouses in on videos before and a lot of times it\u2019s awkward and uncomfortable but Steph always is so cool in these videos. Thanks for the amazing content.",
        "Using science, they came to the correct way to make tea. This is how you make a cup of tea, straight out of the kettle, this is how I, a British person, have done it my whole life. \nBut when doing it from a pot, I think it tastes better, with the milk on the bottom. It also bubbles a little bit, which makes the first couple of sips feel and taste slightly different.",

        "Love this episode don't know why but eh",
        "Very very likely not the first to point this out but somewhat disappointed you didn\u2019t include the temperature of the water as a factor. Definitely not something talked about frequently in English tea but most certainly a factor in other teas. If it\u2019s a factor elsewhere, it\u2019s likely a factor in English tea too!",

Boiling water into empty cup, wait 5 seconds, pour out, add tea bag, pour hot water on bag, let it seep 30 seconds, add sugar and milk, stir, leave bag in cup or remove with 1 finger to lightly press the bag...  no too hard.",

I was very apprehensive about using milk in my tea, but always felt like my plain tea with sugar was too light, if that makes sense. I went out on a limb and added a splash of milk to the top of the cup, and was pleasantly surprised.
