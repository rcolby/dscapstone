        "I think going live would be so cool and from what I\u2019m hearing I think you\u2019d enjoy it as well as us fans. It really does create a sense of community and connection.\nAlso my favs would be your product testing videos and drugstore reviews ",
        "From seeing those first ads for your channel\u2026to driving down to my US mailing address to pick up my Tati vits\u2026.to today\u2026I\u2019ve enjoyed being a part of your journey \ufe0f",
        "Happy YouTube anniversary Tati!! ",
        "Boobra was a memorable video  I would love to see a how to complete look video from outfit to jewelry to hair and makeup. I\u2019m a 35 yr mom of two and the horrible dread of letting myself go is kicking in. The balance between caring too much (of how I look) and not enough is an art I haven\u2019t mastered yet \ufe0f",
        "I think a live would be cool because its new and no beauty chanel is going that way.",
        "I know it's not something you'd normally film but I'd love to see a try on video of your staple clothing pieces, or new things! I think you have such a great fashion sense, I'm always wondering where you shop for clothes!",
        "James throwing water on you was a definite favorite. I love wtf.",
        "Yes been here since the begging.  I was so happy to see you back after you left YouTube for awhile. You have always been my favorite person to watch on YouTube. Love vlogs with you,james,and puka. Day in the life videos.Hope Puka is feeling better! I love the idea of lives and podcasts. Always loved your wtf videos!",
        "Thank you for being so graceful all the time, never regrets supporting you!!",
        "Been here since the beginning...the true raw \"beauty community\" before it even had a name. The early days of Jaclyn Hill, MissJenFabulous, Nicole Guerriero, etc. Before the days of sponsorships and brand deals, makeup lines and collabs, before rings lights and filming on anything but a webcam or phone camera! ",
        "So when my son was born I had the worst postnatal depression. And you became part of my every day sanity.  \n\nSo in the UK your videos would go live at 6pm and every night I would put him in the bath and I would sit on my bathroom floor and watch your videos for a small moment of peace in my day.  A time where I would be totally distracted from what was happening around me. My son would sit and play in the bath and I would sit on the floor beside the bath and just escape it.     You were a massive part of my everyday routine during that dark time. And I think that\u2019s really what YouTube is suppose to be, a place for someone to escape and connect to something bigger than themselves and there own circumstance.",
        "CAN WE take a moment and point out YOUR GLOW?? Literally your hair and skin look ABSOLUTELY PHENOMENAL ",
        "I think your idea of a live would be great. It rings true to the idea of connection and community. And Happy Anniversary to you! I'm one of your ghost viewers who don't leave comments often but when i do watch your videos, I always thumbs up!",
        "9 years \ufe0f Love you Tati ",

        "I\u2019ve been here for a very very long time I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s been all 12 years because I don\u2019t know how to tell but way back to long before James and a lot of purple and wet and wild! I have to many favs to count but I am loving the more homey content! Vlogs if you will! I also love a good dupes and just the tips oh tip Tuesday! I love it all!",
        "I\u2019ve been here since 2013, I just can\u2019t believe it\u2019s been almost 10 years since I\u2019ve been watching you! My favorite videos have been you creating your palette and presenting it to us, just because a lot of us were anxiously waiting for our fav YouTuber to drop her very own line. I had the high hope it would not be a quick cash grab and it would be very high quality and boy you did NOT disappoint!! I have not found to the day a better shadow palette, just because I felt like I was truly part of it. Like you waiting to do something of quality for your subscribers! ",
        "Congrats on 12 years! ",
        "I\u2019ve been here since 2014 and I was in HS now I\u2019m 26 It\u2019s so crazy because this is why I first subscribed to your channel. You are so real and honest, beautiful inside and out, funny and energetic! You\u2019re like a breath of fresh air!  Every time I would come on YouTube if I was having a bad day your videos made me forget all about it. I definitely loved full day wear test videos! helped me so much with picking the best of the best. Before I bought a product I ran to your channel to see what your honest opinion was on it. Love you Tati and I love the idea of going live, watching a movie together, doing a get ready with me, shopping together sounds all great to me! Definitely want to see a video or two, once a week like maybe a live + a video ! Xoxo happy 12 years ",

        "Girl you scared me with that montage!  Thought you were signing off for good!!!",
        "Happy 12th anniversary to us, Tati! ",
        "Honestly, I think the idea of a podcast sounds great. Makeup related, business related, pop culture, family related. It's different and might bring in a new following as well.",
        "Cried watching this...been through so much with Tati",
        "I\u2019ve followed you for years. I LOVE watching you do makeup. I also LOVE LOVE LOVE your more vlog style videos!! ",
        "Tati you are my favorite because you genuinely love the makeup. Its like sitting down with a friend. I feel like a lot of content is rushed or forced these days, but I can always count on you for the real old school makeup videos where you are covered in swatches and just playing in the makeup and having a good time. I truly appreciate that about you and the content you create \u2661",
        "More content about hair, diet, lifestyle videos.  Love your sisters too!",
        "I don\u2019t remember when I started to watch your videos. Probably 8-9 years ago.\nI am glad you came back . \nI like reviews, makeup collection, videos about brands. Makeup organization. \nAnd may be you can try something new like perfume reviews?  ",
        "I've been watching since before you and James got married, been a ride or die ever since \ufe0f I have always loved your style of videos and the length is perfect! Your one of the only \"OG's\" that still make videos and didn't leave it behind for something else... part of the reason why I watch all your videos is your personality, thoughts, opinions and humor! Yes, you kill at makeup and I trust anything you say about a product (TATI APPROVED) but you are also an amazing, grounded, self assured woman and we need that! I stan and I only hope that more people see that",
        "Vlogs!!!!!",
        "I only started watching your videos 5-6 years ago but I feel like I\u2019ve been here forever. Your montage brought tears to my eyes because I thought you were leaving us for good, thank you for not only staying but for giving us more content!\nI would love to see your WTF series come back! Also I love following you along when you shop at Sephora/drug stores ",
        "Would love any content you create  I\u2019ve been watching since 2015 and am so happy you\u2019ve come back to the platform. Your soothing voice and sweet and playful personality would make excellent podcast material too! Love you always, Tati! ",
        "I love watching your videos no matter what they are about but since you wanna know what more we would like to see, i would love to watch home decor videos from you! Your sense in that department is so good and i would love to see how you decorate your new home",
        "I have been watching since the very beginning! I remember your tutorials in your bedroom! I have always loved watching you, so informative and relaxing. Almost like your my close friend  love you Tati",

        "Crying at this intro because I\u2019ve literally grown up watching you \ud83e\udd79 I was 10 when I first started watching!! I didn\u2019t even have an account but would look you up all of the time. Totally shaped my love for makeup and you\u2019ve always been someone I look up to   I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s been 12 years!",
        "Omg I thought you were quitting! Out of the entire beauty community, your videos are the only ones that I watch and have had kept watching for several years now. You were the person that taught me how to do make up all throughout high school and college. I would really hope to see a podcast from you soon. That would be amazing!",
        "WTF was my faveeee BRING HER BACK she was that girllll !! But also a live would be fun",
        "I really miss the Madness Monday's....",

        "I love the personal stories and insights. Single mom of 4 here, make up rarely happens lol . But I have learned a lot about make up by watching your videos.",
        "Thank you so much for not leaving the YouTube community. I didn\u2019t start watching any beauty type videos until 2019 but you are one of the first I found and subscribed to and I have always loved all of your content. My favorites are your most recent couple of years where you seem to be so incredibly humbled and appreciative. Your insight on life is beautiful as are you a person inside and out! No matter what you decide to post, I\u2019ll be here watching. ",
        "For me it was when fleur was on your channel. Xx",
        "I've been here for 5 ish years and you are the only GURU I watch and it is genuinely off of the vibe and comfort I get from watching your videos almost feels like we are actually family. I would love live but honestly anything you are comfortable with. my favorite videos are the 24 hour wear tests !",
        "Tati thank you for being my comfort channel when i needed it the most.. you taught me everything i know when it comes to makeup\u2026 you are my makeup mom \ufe0f ily",
        "I was tearing up thinking you were leaving. You\u2019re the entire reason I\u2019m completely obsessed with makeup, why I\u2019m taking the classes I am so I can go to college and start my own business. My dream is to end up on the shelves of Ulta. I watched the first video of yours 7 years ago, so not from the very beginning, but you and your videos kept me going. It\u2019s weird how someone you don\u2019t even know can be so important in your life. Anyway, glad you\u2019re not leaving. My fav video is definitely the April fools one where you did the blue look. Or the one with Logan. Love you!! ",
        "Found you in 2014! I was a junior in high school trying to find good makeup!",
        "I used to get up and wait for 10am. Been watching for 7years. The weird products was one of my faves. Wtf was really good segment.",
        "I miss you filming going into the drugstores...your WTF series",
        "This made me so emotional. I grew up watching you. You were one of the only makeup artists on youtube where I could watch every second of your videos and always be inspired. Makeup is a stress reliever, a creative outlet and your videos always brought a sense of peace and comfort. Happy 12 years Tati! You deserve it all",
        "I'm not really sure how long I've been watching your videos, probably from 8 to 10 years and it has been like growing up with you, I'm from Mexico but I feel so close to you, like a friend, thank you for all of these years of making content. I love the way you review products and also test them, your gorgeous and such an inspiration",
        "Live chats could be so fun! Congrats on 12 years ",

        "Scot come out lot of stuff , bring him back to y u r channels",
        "Been here from the beginning!! I cried when I got your pallette for Christmas the year it came out. You sparked inspiration in so many.\n\nI loved all those structured videos - wtf, all day wear, ect. ",
        "I would love to see videos on makeup application and techniques but not on yourself but on other people with different shaped eyes, etc.",
        "Omg a tati podcast would be a blessing for my stress and anxiety! \n\nAlso I LOVED the WTF series and full day wear tests \ufe0f",
        "I've been in here for 8 years! I'm 23 now so yes you are my YouTube mama, I literally learned so much from you and Jackie Aina that I dared myself to go to a makeup contest on national TV and got 3rd place against 2 PROFESSIONAL makeup artists!",
        "More: Live QA, haul videos where you take us shopping with you, and detailed technique videos.\nFave videos are with Scott Barnes or your sisters!!",

        "I have watched you since the beginning! I am a trauma nurse and you, Emily Noel and Kathleen Lights have gotten me through some intense, emotional, physically exhausting days! Thank you!",
        "I cried with this video especially when she said I want to let them know that everyone matter  we need more people like Tati",
        "SOOO glad I came across your videos again.  You are definitely one of the OG beauty creators that I have loved and followed for years.  I would love to see more vlog lifestyle videos mixed in with beauty.  Your healthier eating alternatives as well as cleaner, non toxic home and beauty choices",
        "Loved the wtf days. I haven\u2019t been here from the very beginning, but def been a supporter for the past 7 of those years. I miss seeing the craziest most ridiculous products tested and reviewed.",
        "From a fellow Californian who also lived in Texas (now in Kansas), Lifestyle videos all the way!  We definitely experienced the big bugs of Texas! Keep doing you - nothing's wrong with continually evolving!",
        "Please don't go to Tiktok .. i refuse to give that app any attention.  And the Podcast world is so over saturated. We don't need more people on trends. We need more quality youtube videos. Please stay here.   more drugstore stuff would be more realistic in this day and age as less and less people can justify LaMer prices over CeraVe ...",
        "I still love full day wear tests, full face of one brand, monthly favorites, pr unboxing, etc.",
        "I\u2019ve been watching for 12 years. I really missed you when you were gone and if I had to choose only one beauty person to watch, it will be you!",
        "Shop online together, live, and then try it...",
        "I have been with you about 10 years. I came to you as a teenager looking for makeup help, because my mom was always too busy working to teach me stuff like that. Today, I\u2019m the person that women and girls in my life come to for makeup/hair advice. You\u2019ve not only impacted me and taught me a love for makeup, helping my self-confidence in the process, but you have helped me bond with loved ones. Thank you for everything, Tati ",
        "I would love to see a \u201cBack to Basics\u201d series. I know you\u2019ve done them before but an updated version would be great. You can teach us how to do makeup looks for special events. Weddings, Birthdays & Date nights. ",
        "I miss the old Youtube with the long video/reviews. I agree I can't deal with the shorts/Instagram/Tik-toks. I like the more in-depth videos discussing the pros/cons of products etc. The full day wear test videos would be great!",
        "I would love to hear your honest thoughts about life, struggles, current events even.. just hearing you talk honestly and candidly is so therapeutic and I relate to that so much. I\u2019m currently going through the most beautiful spiritual journey where I genuinely feel like I\u2019m strengthening my soul and making myself a stronger person and it seems you are too. I\u2019d love to just hear your honest open dialogue about pretty much anything. I\u2019ll be watching whatever you come up with.",
        "I love you lifestyle stuff!!   Vlogs",
        "Self care ,skin care, something on that line.",
        "Dupes, Amazon favorites, indi makeup reviews, speed reviews. As a professional makeup artist these types of videos are the most useful for me. I think I found your channel 10-11 years ago ",
        "I love videos with James! \nBut also any videos that are using your current collection in creative ways. I\u2019m less interested in new new all the time.",
        "I love the idea f a live! Because of the time difference I wouldn\u2019t be able to watch live but would def catch up on it! Xx",
        "I am from London and have been here since you used to hang out with Fleur deForce and obviously you did her wedding 9 years ago. I now don\u2019t watch any YouTube videos anymore, except yours. For me your videos are comfort and I treat them as my self care time with a cup of tea and a cake when my two children (under 2) are napping at lunchtime. It\u2019s like getting a hug and helps me recover for the second half of my day when the chaos starts again. Thank you for all you do for us - we are loyal and so invested in you. I personally love your sit down and chat videos where you just get ready. Always love it when James pops in too!",
        "I like that idea about community. I have been trying to figure out how to do that too.",
        "The videos with Scott Barnes, I watch non stop. They\u2019re just everything",
        "I remember when I first started watching you Tati. You used to sit on your bed.  I never had an account to leave messages but I watched every video! And I miss those wtf videos and I miss all the hats you wore to the store ! You always have given your real opinion on products and that\u2019s why I watch. You\u2019re real. You keep it real even if you don\u2019t like the product you say so.  I watch every single video (and I agree those tictoks and reels are terrible ",
        "Scott Barnes on your channel, doing your makeup, was an incredible video. I watched it several times, loving seeing your joy and his exquisite talent, was a pinnacle moment. Also, I'm never giving up my Tati Palette ",
        "How you make your videos  how you set Up your lights, choose your products, make mistakes etc",
        "I was 12 when I started watching your videos. I'm 24 now, a working makeup artist. Because of you. I love you ",
        "I would love videos of you updated favourites . One week do moisturizer, then lip products, then foundation\u2026 etc",
        "Personally I came it late, but I love the vlogging. Because especially now it definitely feels like when you vlog, you are your true self. But ultimately whatever your comfortable with ",
        "I got to know you 3 years ago during the 'drama time' but later on I started watching your content despite I don't wear makeup, but I'm a creative person like you. I'd like to see challenges on the third day of the week. They're fun and you've made some in the past",
        "SEPHORA SWEEP",
        "Vlogs girl! Would love that once a week!",

        "I miss WTF series so much!",
        "One of the best videos I like is Scott Barnes being on and doing your makeup. I\u2019d love to see what other makeup artist would do on you. What is there go to? And you doing others make up (mom, sisters).\nAll you videos are so informative and I\u2019ve loved watching you the last 5/6 years",
        "Favourite videos were the og madness monday ones and when the store would get mad at you for filming. And when Fleur came to get Puka with you. \nYour wedding, James joining unboxings. I feel like I just grew with you and your content and will always be the biggest fan of your energy and soul. I\u2019d watch you review paint drying for an hour over watching a TikTok. Personally not a fan of short videos, I\u2019m far too lazy to go find another video to watch. ",
        "I found your channel 5 years ago when I was scrolling through YouTube suggested videos while I was taking my 30 minutes 2 times a day pumping breast milk at work for my newborn and subscribed immediately! I watched all of your new videos and almost all of your prior content at that point. I was so bummed you were gone in 2020. I missed your content so much and I\u2019m SO glad you\u2019re back and better than ever with James ",
        "I\u2019d love to see more about TX. City tour. Or a 30 minute walk and talk around the area.",
        "I have been following since Mr Kate did your makeup room, more amazing YouTubers that sort of had a slump in views, which makes no sense to me!! I found you and have been hooked since. I\u2019m going to be for the people for my new Bohbaby brand  such a great idea",
        "I miss the WTF\u2019s!!!",
        "Hello Tati, \nGod is so good and has blessed you very much! So happy you will continue with your videos!\nI have been watching you for many years, and enjoyed your videos very much!\nI would love to see reviews with high end products, that I think would be very useful  to many before paying a high price in a product.",

        "U are the first one I started watching on YouTube during Covid, I enjoyed very much and bought many products and learned how to use make up. I\u2019m interested in skin care and  home design. I like the utube version",
        "I haven't  been here from the very start, but I started watching at 19, young and fresh when I was trying to be a pretty young woman in a business world. I'm now 27. I made 10 years in my military career in November, and for almost my entire career your videos have helped me decompress and learn how to feel beautiful in my own skin working in a still predominantly man's world and job. Thank you for the years of love and commitment and for teaching me how to do my makeup from work days to going out. I'm ready for many to come, no matter the content you feel creatively to produce. You are amazing!! Thank you!",
        "Love you Tati \ufe0f",
        "I love your life style vlogs",
        "Tati I have been with you for all 12 years!!! since i started college as a freshman. you posted your engagement video and James proposal. \n\nI watched your tip Tuesdays In front of your mirror closet and hot or not Thursdays. I went shopping during madness Mondays and busted out all my coupons as a broke college student to laughing so heartily during  Your ice bucket challenge. Watching your wedding planning Wednesday series to grieving with you and James after the loss of his dear friend. Celebrated with you when you got pooka and cheered you on seeing your wedding video.  I screamed for joy when you launched Halo and was so nerve wracked refreshing my webpage to get ahold of the beloved story palette. ",
        "I loved WTF and full day wear test! Love you Tati!!",
        "I'm 68, been watching for about 7-8 years. When I was working I did makeup almost every day, now I just wear it when I want to - which still is most days, TBH. I like the way makeup makes me feel, and since I have chronic illnesses, my husband tells me he knows when I feel bad because I wear more makeup! God bless, glad you left the west coast, get some southern in ya! Texas is not that far from Alabama, where I live, so stop by sometime!",
        "More vlogs about your daily life, or lives on Fridays would be so fun!!!",

        "my prefered ones are those with James, your love for each other make me feel so happy and they bring me down to earth\u2026it's so easy to feel disconnected on the internet\u2026but you, sweet Tati, always make me feel good and keep me grounded \ud83e\udef6\ufe0f\ufe0f",
        "I have to say, I kinda freaked out thinking you were leaving YouTube again from the beginning throwbacks. I really enjoy watching you and James just doing normal everyday things. Your connection puts a smile on my face and we all love James! I always loved watching your WTF videos, they were so fun and a lot of the things you pulled was seriously WTF. We love you Tati!",
        "A live weekly would be really fun!",
        "I would love affordable skincare and makeup reviews",

        "I loved the monday drugstore vlogs!",
        "You will forever be synonymous with my solo Paris trip in 2015. I was 25, I went on my first trip alone, and I wanted something to watch while doing my makeup in the mornings - and there was Tati! \nI love the fact that you don't plan on doing short form content. It can be hilarious, and I follow some short form creators, but I like to have a variety of videos in my subscription inbox. Some channels are breakfast content for me. Some are listen-only content. Others are while-I'm-getting-ready content. Others yet are evening-after-dinner content. It would be awful if there was only two minute videos getting uploaded. ",
        "Oh my goodness! I\u2019ll watch anything you put out there. Love the WTF and the 24 hour wear tests. \nSo glad you aren\u2019t going to make shorts.\nHappy Anniversary!",
        "Maybe you should bring more people on your show who maybe have a small business or a cause or something,  but just have a fun casual conversation and talk about their product or cause a little,  but don't make it all about that.  I would also love maybe some lifestyle videos.  I enjoy everything you create.",
        "I truly would love a combo of fun Tati reviewing what\u2019s new and good and what look you\u2019re wearing, ALONG WITH you giving a podcast style hearing what\u2019s going on with you and your life and believes on what\u2019s going on in the world, with Texas and your new life!",
        "More vlogs! Seeing you and James together is uplifting. Also I think lives could be fun to try!",
        "I want to see a video on: \n- Whats in my everyday purse\n-Nighttime Routine\n-your 5 min face",
        "I\u2019ve been here since the beginning!!! I loved the content you put out",
        "I would absolutely adore a weekly live!! I love love love \u201changing out\u201d with you through your videos and I\u2019ve been watching your channel for years and years because of it. So a chill hang out, go online shopping, watch a movie, or get ready together type of live on the weekend would be lovely",
        "I stopped watching you since the drama with everything. I even bought your eyeshadow palette when it first came out. I love you and I love this. Thank you for being one of the only YouTubers to try to bring it back to its roots. You are so beautiful and I can\u2019t wait for this. \ufe0f",
        "WTF videos",
        "I would love more of anything but sprinkling lifestyle favorites is always a fav of mine. ",
        "The first time I saw your channel was video about reviewing essence makeup, I believe in hot or not video maybe in 2011  since then I love your all reviews makeup brand  from drugstore to luxury one, even though I live in small country in south east asia, Idkw I still believe your reviews, your not only talking about what's good or not, but thought me some knowledge behind makeup or how to use etc  please be with us forever ",
        "Interactive live sounds so nice!",
        "I'm here for the long haul too. I've been here for around 10 years! It's been so lovely to grow up myself seeing you grow up! \n\nI know you've had a very hard few years but it's so nice to see you come out the other side ",
        "I love the idea of weekly lives on Fridays, it would be the perfect way to wrap up the week! And I LOVE your longer videos!",
        "I've not been around for too long but I sure love you and James. You're the cutest couple with so much personality between you  Loved the few clips of your wedding!",
        "You should do a weekly live while you do your makeup in the morning and just chat with your audience :) Just low pressure, no fuss, relaxing chit chat",
        "Congrats Tati! During the time of COVID, I really felt a change in makeup trends and popular products that everyone used to use aren't so popular anymore. I would love to see you go back through categories like you previously have and show us what your top 10 ten of different products are.",
        "I would love to see more reviews on colorpop or other cheap but good quality makeup",
        "When you wrote XO\u2019s Tati on the mirror I had tears. Wow. Beautiful video. I haven\u2019t watched you from the very beginning but it\u2019s been a long time. So grateful you came back  Full day wear tests  or more lifestyle/food/fashion!  Honestly I\u2019ll watch anything and I know I\u2019ll enjoy it.",
        "I love the shopping videos and I love full\nReviews and wear tests also love the PR hauls I\u2019m not even sure how many years I\u2019ve been watching you but it has been A long time!",
        "Tutorial",
        "I love the live idea as well as the wear test!",
        "Panic!!! Thought for sure you were leaving YouTube! Phew!!! What if: don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s possible, but we could somehow share what we do for a living, send you a pic of ourselves and you give advice on what type of makeup or routine we should do? For example: I\u2019m a nurse that works 12-14 hour shifts (and I am 52). I need something quick in the early early mornings. I leave the house at 500am for work. I concentrate mostly on making my eye stand out because of the masks, of course using your volume 1 palette ",
        "I\u2019m so thankful to see you back on YouTube! I\u2019ve been watching you since 2015\u2013 and seen a lot of ups and downs for many creators in that time. \n\nI\u2019m not a big fan of the shorts\u2014I enjoy the long form videos\u2014I loved your WTF videos, and your drugstore videos! I also love your deep dives on one brand! ",
        "I\u2019ve been watching you for going on 8 years now. Love all your content and so glad you are still here doing what YOU love! Since you asked, I really enjoyed your natural product reviews and would enjoy seeing more.  Take care! XOXO",
        "I loved the full day wear tests! Seeing a kind of vlog of your life was my favorite of your videos. They just felt so intimate going through the whole day with Tati and what you do in your day to day. \ufe0f you go Tati",
        "I subscribed in 2015. Your glam makeup style doesn\u2019t match my minimalistic style, but I\u2019ve always stuck around for you and your personality. You\u2019re such a calming presence. The live idea with movies and shopping sounds amazing. It feels like everyone is doing a podcast these days and it honestly feels like people will look back like they did on daily vlogging and feel burnt out. It\u2019s a lot of time. You\u2019re typically very polished and put together - that\u2019s part of your charm, so I honestly don\u2019t know if long unedited content is for you. Editing such long content is a job and a half. I\u2019m not the biggest podcast fan - I just don\u2019t know what people talk about for such a long time. Lifestyle content would be amazing! Cooking, organizing, shopping, movies, books, home decor, etc. It also helps us get to know you better. Jessica Braun is a great example of someone with a great personality who reviews  makeup, just not all the time. Makeup is great, but there\u2019s so much content out there on technique and most of us already have too much makeup. The WTF series would be fun, too. You always put so much effort into finding interesting thing to try out. Again, it could be makeup or a mix. At least with this you wouldn\u2019t be reviewing the same thing as 1,000 other people. Whatever you decide to do, even if it\u2019s a podcast, I\u2019ll still watch!",
        "Fashion stuff like the expensive bags etc you regret , love u! you inspire us all",
        "I think a podcast would be so fun! But, I think it would be better to put it on a separate channel. As a viewer/listener, I think that would make it easier to keep track of episodes (especially with the current mess on the Subscriptions page). I'd LOVE to see some livestreams on this channel instead!",
        "Hi Tati, back to basics for sure, but I love love love your vlogs! And videos don\u2019t need to be over 20 minutes. You have so much makeup knowledge and life experience to share with us. Looking forward to your new videos. \ufe0f",
        "I\u2019ve watched you since the Makeup Graveyard days and I\u2019m still tuning in  Your kindness, resilience and commitment to your viewers are only a few of the reasons why\u2026here\u2019s to all that you have to offer in the years ahead ",
        "I love tips and tricks, I love when you have James on, I love when do reviews and new make reviews, I love hearing about your life and your walk with the lord. I love you before you left and even more now. I learned how to apply makeup from you. I grew up not allowed to even wear or how to apply it. You taught me. I am sure there are others out there you can teach like me. I just want to say thank you so much. Lives would be good just not all the time. I was so happy when you came back. I am not perfect at makeup but you taught there is no wrong way just keep practicing and because of you I have gotten better.",
        "Im not into short videos either",
        "i'd love to see you talk about ingredients in products and getting more sciency! i feel like u have a loooot of knowledge on this topic xoxo",

        "From day one baby!!",
        "I\u2019ve been here all 12 years, you were one of the first Beauty Gurus and YouTubers in my childhood. You, Nikitutorials, Game theory/Matt Pat and Stephanie, The Oddsones out, Nerdy numiies/Rosana pansino, Jaidden animations were some of the people that shaped me growing up. Thank you for everything",
        "I would watch anything.I like your daily routines too.\ufe0f\ufe0f",
        "I want to see all the good stuff. Full face of _ , all day wear test, product reviews, products you love, products you don't love",
        "I say pod cast! Your voice is so relaxing to me. Honestly the majority of my time \u201cwatching\u201d is actually just listening lol",
        "I wish I knew you twelve years ago! But I have been watching for 9 years! Love you Tati, I have always watched your content. I love live shopping online or blogging with James! Friday\u2019s! Love to you! ",
        "I've whatched you for about 7 years, my favourite was vids when your family members participated",
        "Love you tati i still have my tati pallet, years later and it's still perfect (maybe expired but i can't let it go)",
        "Started watching nearly 8yrs ago and it was your wear test reviews that I loved. Like a proper deep dive into the performance of the product. No one was doing that. Also love your full try ons when you tested all colours from the range etc",
        "Been watching for the longest time. I remember recommending your channel to a few people. Watching you grow really made me happy. You\u2019re iconic",
        "Love when you vlog! ",
        "I have been here from the beginning. I have been here for the ups and the downs for the good and for the bad. I am so grateful you are back. You are one of those YouTubers I sit back and watch when I need a break from reality. I am mostly bed bound and I suffer from major depressive disorder and anxiety. I don't get to play with makeup as I used to. My love affair with it has not died down however. I can't even begin to tell you the emotion. I felt when I got the notification that you posted a video. When you came back. I felt a warmth come over me from the top of my head to the tips of my toes. I was almost frozen and then able to move because I could not believe my eyes. I really thought my eyes were tricking me. Thank you for coming back. You are one of my tools in my toolbox for fighting my depression and my anxiety. A live once a week would be so utterly fantastic. I would really enjoy that. I do not have a preferred time because I don't work. Going to pretty much just lay in bed morning, noon and night. So I am ready for that. That is my vote ! Keep being you ",
        "Would love to see more of your dedicated videos, could never get enough of those!",
        "Hi Tati!!! This is so sweet, I would love a live on Fridays! Also product reviews are my favorite videos to watch, and of course whenever you film with james",
        "I\u2019d love to see different eye looks using your palette. I also love your wear tests and product reviews.",
        "More videos on your makeup techniques and \u201chow\u201d YOU do what you do please!!! \ufe0f",

        "Vlogs!!! I love your vlogs! I love you and your channel but I'm just not that into makeup videos anymore, but that's just me, I pretty much only watch vlogs now \ufe0f",
        "I started watching madness monday videos and have been watching since!",
        "Congratulations on 12 years Tati <3",
        "I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been here for all 12 years, but I have been a fan for at least 10 of your 12 years on YouTube and I\u2019ve enjoyed it every step of the way ",
        "Your one brand videos where you explored one brand, be it drugstore or luxury, exploring the best of that brand and telling us where to save our money was such a favourite series of mine, and it really helped my Mua kit back in the day too ",
        "I love this! I love that you\u2019re reaching out and asking everyone what they think and I\u2019ve been a long time viewer of yours and I absolutely love WTF videos and I love the idea of going, live and having a community chat!",
        "Address skin changes from aging products to lines and wrinkles. Weather changes skin dryness keeping up our face canvas makes the art of makeup different as well. I turned 54 this year and have so many questions no one else is talking about.",
        "Tutorials",
        "I love the single product reviews.",
        "I have loved watching you through the years. I found your channel in 2016 and fell in love. I always call you my makeup mama, because even through a computer screen you just seem so caring and genuine like you are right in the room with us. I am so glad you are continuing to stick to YouTube considering other people in your situation may just quit when they find views dropping, but not you and we will always be here to watch and cheer you on! This may sound weird but I have always loved your sense of style in home decor and would love a live of shopping for your home decor items, but of course anything makeup related is always appreciated! Please bring back Hot or Not and WTF, best series ever!!! Again, thank you for always being here with a smile and not leaving YouTube forever. It was very unfortunate that you got dragged into the toxic beauty community drama but you handled it with grace. You managed to be in the community for over 10 years without being involved in the drama, as most beauty YouTube creators literally get caught up in the drama in the first year. I am glad you are still here and am looking forward to the beauty community being loving and drama free once again",
        "I love the idea of a live! Or just the soothing \"get ready with me\" because every Monday and Thursday I watch your videos as I put on my makeup and literally get ready with you. It feels like there is a friend nearby. \u2661 We love hearing stories about your youth, your life, and your family. ",
        "I have been a subscriber for many years and love your makeup content the most their so awesome  I have learned about so many makeup products I have bought because you reviewed them and I feel in love with and some I repurchased. My favorite video of your is apart of a series I wish you would bring back it\u2019s where you showed deal from cvs and Walgreens , rite aid , Target and Walmart the sales and coupons of the week and then reviewed all the makeup. I hope you and James, Puka have a Very Happy Thanksgiving ",
        "So happy for that milestone of yours! We will be here for the next 12 and more \ufe0f",
        "Thank you for always being raw and real with us. You'll never know how much you've helped me and others. As a trans woman you've taught me do much more about womanhood than just make up. Seeing you get married, seeing you grow as a business woman and even just growing as a woman.",
        "Congrats on 12 years!!! I have really enjoyed your vlogging and living vicariously hoping to get to Texas myself. Could you ever do a dupe for your palette? I bought one for my mom for Christmas and was going to get one for myself as soon as I had the money but then it was announced it was going away for good. I was so sad I missed out. I've always loved your collabs no matter who they were with. Hoping for many great years ahead!",
        "You've grown in such good ways. I've been here at least 6 years, probably longer. I've cried and laughed with you, felt angry for you, proud of you for your success and missed you while you weren't filming. You're like a sister. You are such a real, genuine person and that's why so many can truly feel connected to you.  I love all your content so whatever you choose to do I'll watch. My favorite are tutorials and WTF too. We love you  Thank you for giving us 12 years!",
        "I\u2019ve been watching you for so long\u2026I don\u2019t remember when I started watching but I remember meeting you at the galleria in Houston with Birchbox in 2015. Your content has always been amazing but it\u2019s you as a person that has made we loved watching for so long. Rooting for you always! ",

        "Wonderful video so amazing\ufe0f I found you maybe 6 years ago from a product  review i was looking for! I dont normally comment but you are a comfort show vibe for me and i love that\ufe0f your wedding video was amazing. I loved ur drugstore vs highend videos, top 10 or 5 in each category i would watch every video! Below price point videos. I used to work at Sephora but a drugstore lover so I love the comparison between the two. More recently the pr unboxings with james and his son were my faves. Love you gir happy to still have you 12 years later  xo",
        "Omg I seen the title and thought you were leaving!!  Thank god you\u2019re not and Thank you for being the light for a lot of us. It\u2019s crazy how fast the years have gone by. Lots of love!!",

        "I'm not crying.... it's just allergies.... \ud83e\udd79",
        "It's crazy, that 2 years ago, most of her videos had around 1 million views. Now they are sitting under 500K. How consuming content has changed in 2 years is really saying something. \nI do scroll through reels etc. a lot myself. But if I need a full review or a step-by-step, those are not sufficient. They can be fun for sure. Johnny Ross is hilarious in his shorts. Maybe you two can do a colab?",
        "Bring back the WTF series please!!",

Talk about the products you use  - shampoo, soaps, house cleaner, etc.  I have found myself on the same health journey as you and am so interested in what you\u2019ve learned, started doing, etc., on your journey! I was so excited to find out that YOU use beef tallow!! I\u2019ve been using tallow as a full body lotion for almost a year now, and I now consider it a part of our first-aid kit for skin injuries! When you mentioned you use a drip coffee pot, I bought one immediately and have used it since! I\u2019m so intrigued and would love to hear more about what you know!",
        "It has been so crazy! YT has changed so much. The community has been declining. I miss the full day wear test, one brand, drug stores weekly ads, and videos of you and James...",

        "I have been here since the beginning. You have been my escape. You were the first Channel I ever subscribed to. I used you watch your videos and they would and still do inspire me. You take away the shallowness of this industry and really do make the makeup industry about empowerment and being a strong women and having confidence. So Thank you.",
        "Your videos gave me confidence to try make up and to have with it. All that led me to have more love for myself and to not put so much pressure on myself to look a certain way.

        "I personally enjoying seeing the \"real life\" moments. Maybe not quite like a vlog video a little more \"life style\" videos. It feels personal and less like sitting in a studio holding up a product and testing it. I would also love to see how to accessories different makeup look...like what type of makeup or colors go with jewelry, hair styles and outfits. Sometimes I get inspired by an a color in an outfit and it ends up looking too \"matchy-matchy\" and the head to toe look blends too much together. You always have a great sense of style and you coordinate in a such a way that things compliment.",

I\u2019d love for little tips and tricks about how you make your videos sprinkled in. You have shown your awareness of the set up all along and let us share in that as well. Pointers from someone that just does it all so well would be greatly appreciated (at least by me ) As far as revisiting ideas WTF have always been a fav, because sometimes the insanely priced products ARE good, and how would the average consumer know that? And, on a personal note, I love it when you just chat about a topic from the heart. Keep up your amazing work - here\u2019s to another 12 years of enjoying being able to see you smile, empathize through tears, and share some time together.",
        "Pleeeeaaassslllleee! Bring back the tati pallet! I broke mine! It was my staple!!",
        "I am drown to your honesty, integrity, love and you are an example of the kind of woman I want to be! Thank you ",
        "I\u2019ve been with you for about 10 years  I recognized so many of those backgrounds. What a journey! I wholeheartedly agree on creating more of a community. I think live streams would be exactly where to start with that. I also think creating member spaces would be awesome. Patreon or here on YouTube. I\u2019d pay subscribe to you for exclusive content or member only lives. You know Tati - I actually found  Emily D Baker because of you. Which is kinda weird because it wasn\u2019t for things going well in your life. But I went to that video back in Nov 2020 that she uploaded & discovered she was creating a community over there. A welcoming, caring, non judgmental space\u2026 she was so respectful toward you\u2026.and so I stay there. (And never left here). I think you have that same magic - just by being yourself and allowing us to engage with you in real time. Share stories, memories and things we have in common. I\u2019ve been here for 10 years\u2026 I\u2019m not going anywhere and can\u2019t wait to see where we all go with you next.  ",
        "I want more tati",
        "Hey Tati! I\u2019ve been watching you since High School. Now I\u2019ve graduated college and I\u2019m 4 years into my career.",
        "I love the simple daily life videos.  I could watch  2 hrs  of that.",
        "Awwwwwwww your such a classy wonderful lady \ufe0f I adore you and your channel  Godspeed everyone ",
        "With you since the beginning. You get better and better each day. Grateful for you.",
        "I like your longer videos. I put them on and do my laundry, do my makeup, draw, design, etc. Because they are little longer I can just listen, enjoy and get through my task without flipping around so much. I guess I have a long attention span. Didn't have a cell until college. ",
        "Tati, been following for years! But never commented, you are the only make up channel I watch! Love your videos, two part question  have you tried and reviewed Jones Road Beauty and how do keep Puka\u2019s eyes stained free? I hope he is doing so much better ",
        "I never wore makeup or knew anything about it until I was about 35. The first of your videos I watched was with you and Scott Barnes, and I was mesmerized! I love watching your videos as much for the information as I do for the community. I don't follow a ton of YouTubers, but I appreciate your candor when it comes to drug store vs high end makeup, which ones work well in spite of the price point and those that fall short. Declutters are always fun because you're really weighing similar products against each other which gives us insight into what you would buy again or that you find real value in. I would say the same goes for videos like this where you evaluate past purchases. A high end bag should last years, and for that reason, I agree that you should look for one that you can wear with anything! The same goes for jewelry. If you're going to spend the money on it, you need to be able to get your money's worth out of it! Thanks for sharing everything!!!",
        "My favorite videos of yours are still product reviews and best drugstore products. Best of lipstick. Best of concealers. Best in every category as new things keep coming out. Would also love to see more tutorials even of your hair lol your hair is iconic \ud83e\udef6 my biggest wish is that you being back Tati beauty for sure though. That\u2019s my Christmas wish this year lol.  ",
        "Lifestyle stuff, fashion, more makeup, vlogs of you and James, decor ideas, old school stuff like mile long CVS receipts and how to get cheap makeup, diet and exercise, hell read the phonebook. I will always watch every single video you post. I've watched you since 2015 and I consider you a friend! Love you Tati!! ",
        "There's so many good videos it's hard to pick....\ufe0fIt's been a long time and a lot of videos.\ufe0f",
        "Tatiana hon, you are the beauty authority of YouTube. I will always 100% heed your reviews ",
        "I love your show an your make up products. I watch all your vedios. \ufe0f You tati.",
        "Lives!! Do a LIVE! then slowly do a podcast. But I think a LIVE will be amazing! Don\u2019t do it on weekends do it on a weekday evening",
        "Hi Tati! I\u2019ve bee with you a while and tbh I dropped off on the makeup community but I will say that you have drawn me back in and I\u2019m so glad to see you continuing. I really used to enjoy your series so I won\u2019t mind if you bring some back",
        "I remember you mentioned about your exploration around piano music and some songs you had started to write in terms of spirituality and thriving after the storms in life which are more lessons and manners to help us see how stronger we truly are and that we never walk alone. Also it could be nice to maybe do vlogs in areas in Texas that you are liking or just visiting for the first time.",
        "Omg what an accomplishment for someone. Not just a YouTuber who is continuing to grow and deliver after all this time, but to put it bluntly, as a woman over 30 in an industry that's not kind to maturation (not that any industry really is but the beauty world especially)\nYou're someone I look up to and I'm so amazed at what you've accomplished. Can't wait to see the next 12 years!!",
        "Vlogging!",
        "I joined halfway, 6 years ago, and currently today you are only one left that I make sure that I don't miss a single video from. I hope you continue as it all is- we love you <3",
        "Please announce another Tati Beauty palette there\u2019s nothing like that palette",
        "Weekly vlog! Or live.",
        "I just want to say Thank you Tati for allowing yourself to be vulnerable and to show who you really are on the internet. Im a 31 year old female and you have been my inspiration to FEEL beautiful for a long time now, over 6 years. You went through tragedy, loss, love. You lost yourself and found yourself time and time again, that alone helps me so much to realize that life isn't linear. You've taught me that i have to fight against what people WANT to give myself what i truly NEED. Thank you Tati for showing your life through a camera so a stranger, like me, can be confident in who we are and what we want to achieve despite our age. We are STRONG! and you gave me and so many others that feeling of being a strong independent person. Sending so much love and support to you and your fam alone with anyone else who needs it! <3 <3 <3",
        "Congratulations on 12 years Tati! I think I\u2019ve been watching your videos for at least 8/9 years. You\u2019re my absolute favorite beauty YouTuber! I understand your wanting to maybe keep things fresh, but honestly, don\u2019t fix it if it\u2019s not broken! Your videos are wonderful! I loved wtf, 24 hour test and ALLLL your make up and skin care reviews.  I appreciate the eyeshadow swatches, the potentially painful lipstick try ons, and your passion for makeup. Thank you for all you do! ",
        "Love you so much Tati! Thank you for always making my day a little warmer.",
        "I personally would love a once a week live sit down with you just doing our makeup and getting the best tips from you and having some laughs as well. We adore you so so much and thank you for devoting so much of your time to us. Thank you for all of it!",
        "VLOGSSSSSSS!!!!! Love youuuuuuu  so happy you came back!",
        "Vlogs! I love watching everyday lives, cleaning, cooking, getting ready. morning routines",
        "Been watching you since 2016 and you are the reason I blow money on makeup  I would appreciate if you can make In detail videos how to makeup",
        "Happy anniversary!!! \nI have been here since 2012. All of your videos have been so entertaining. I would like to watch anything you feel like is the least stressful and fun for you to make! I would t still be around if you weren\u2019t entertaining. I would totally be down for a live video with a chat. That would be so much fun! Or even a home vlog! \ud83e\udef6",
        "Here near the ending, I\u2019m definitely down with you doing some lives! I fully enjoy your vlog type videos as well!",
        "Been with you for at least 10 years! Love the WTF series and overall hearing your voice. It\u2019s so soothing ",
        "please do \"get ready to sleep\" routine after attending a glam event",
        "I have watched your videos about 1 year now and I\u2019ve learned alot about beauty and products. I think a video with James is a good mix and you both are great together. Thanks for sharing.",
        "Bring back WTF series please.",
        "Lifestyle, health, cooking, diet. You've transformed your self in multiple areas and it would be nice to share knowledge and experience.  I know we are all unique but we still have common threads and it would be cool to share how to truly live our best lives.",
        "Tati you said it.. times are changing.. try tiktok people love you here and they\u2019re going to love you there. And you don\u2019t have to leave yt do long videos too because you\u2019re amazing. But also try something new because you\u2019ll create something new.. i love you ",
        "Do vlogs!",
        "Plz do weekly foundation wear test videos! I can never get enough of them! Been with u since the very beginning \ufe0f love u and the journey",
        "Podcast ",
        "I loved the WTF series, finding new brands - indies and high end- I appreciated your input on the products! I found so many new fun makeup loves from your recommendations!",
        "Damn, I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s been 12 yrs. I learned to put on fake lashes from you. Damn 12 yrs, I am 46 now. 12 YEARS!!!!  I refuse to get IG/TT. I am glad you are still posting long form content. I still order your Halo regularly. Keep doing videos, makeup tutorials, live chat would be fun.",
        "Clean beauty, clothing hauls or home decor",
        "I think you should do some combined videos , and what makes you happy based on the products that cought you eye threw the week.",
        "I\u2019ve been following you since I was 14 in 2014, when I got my first foundation I went through your videos to decide which one to get cuz your reviews have always been very in depth and thorough. The beauty community is definitely not the giant that it was but I\u2019m glad you\u2019re still posting and keeping it real",
        "I\u2019ve missed WTF videos but I\u2019d watch anything you put out honestly ! The podcast/live sounds pretty good too!",
        "Happy anniversary!!! I think I started watching around 2014/2015, I learnt so many things from you! One of my tip-Tuesdays tips that I start doing at this time of year is warming up my mascara before application... I put it under my boob whilst I do the rest of my make up ",
        "Bring James , and makeup or skin care  for man , you could make a episodes about it. I'm a guy and I'm watching you videos for many years all ready. Love you guys",
        "Yes Tati! I\u2019ve been with you from the beggining, when you sat on a bed! \ufe0f Forever you fan! \nI would like to see more videos with you and James, or your sisters, mother, James\u2019s son. I loved WTF as well.",

        "Thank you foe transforming our makeup game and especially teaching us all your beauty secrets ",

        "Would love,  makeup tutorials, and vlogs and both u and James",
        "Would love to see product reviews again from sephora and ulta. Non drug store reviews.",
        "I found you in 2014, so almost 10 years!!!!! You will always be my favorite beauty youtuber. I was working at South Center Nordy when you were in downtown! It's been surreal to follow your journey. The best part has been seeing you openly profess your love for God now, it's so beyond heart warming and encouraging.",
        "I\u2019ve honestly been watching your videos since I was 16, barely getting into makeup! I have always resonated with your simple sit down videos. I would like to see maybe more videos with you and James, as those are my favorite! Maybe also bringing in celebrity makeup artists like Mario/Scott Barnes on your channel. I just love love you and your channel and THANK YOU FOR THE LAST 12 YEARS! HERES TO MANY MANY MORE!",
        "One video with beauty, makeup, and fashion and maybe one video that\u2019s a vlog style.",
        "I remember being 18 or so and just learning makeup and wanting to buy the best i could with the little i had and then i found the madness monday videos and i was so hooked on those. I just can't believe that was 12 years ago. Your videos have always veen so great and positive and you send such a good energy out into the world. \ufe0f",
        "Hi Tati I remember the first time i came across a video of yours was how to clean a beauty blender  and ive been here ever since ",
        "Absolutely love your vlogs, and I\u2019m a fan of the 24 hr wear videos. I remember finding your channel 10 years ago when I was deep in post-partum blues. I would watch your videos & they motivated me to pull myself together & reminded me that I was more than just a mom. I was a beautiful woman! ",
        "I loved your moving vlogs",
        "Love this video Tati, wow what a 12 years!!! I\u2019m into your vlogs, love a WTF, and I\u2019m definitely into a podcast series with you and some special guests maybe. Would definitely be into a live video, on a weekend would be fab for us working women. ",

        "You're still my favorite youtuber Tati!",
        "Love your channel. My vote for content would be tutorials- your artistry and skills are unmatched",
