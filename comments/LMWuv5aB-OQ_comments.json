After the many occurrences of Dark Revival being delayed or even cancelled it feels like a breath of fresh air to finally see the game released. I remember the day Bendy first came out and to this day I am still a very huge fan of the franchise. I remembered playing and enjoying the game back then and while yes their were a lot of issues that didn\u2019t stop me from playing and enjoying the gameplay and figuring out all of the lore. And seeing Dark Revival, it manages to kind of fix the problems that Ink Machine doe and managed to make it better. Overall seeing Dark Revival I am still legit excited to see how this game continues to go, also Cartoon Bendy is the most adorable thing I have ever seen fight me.",

The film was chemically coated to allow for a specially formulated ink to be applied by an artist working on a magnifying table. This allowed for adjustment, action enhancements, or even whole new characters to be added after the cartoon had been photographed. Mr. Drew intended for  the format to be used some day to create 'interactive' experiences where the cartoons could be custom altered to fit the occasion or audience.",
