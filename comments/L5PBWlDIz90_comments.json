Seems highly likely they'll cause further problems at Zaporizhzhia or elsewhere as a means of attrition. They clearly don't care about losses, which is also a pretty common russian trait",
        "It concerns me that this is simply a tactical withdrawal,  There is satellite imagery of significant defenses being built on the other side of the river, and also reports of artillery and troops being diverted to them. It seems like if Ukraine takes Kherson they'll be dealing with a city full of traps, while enduring heavy shelling.
