I know people progress and move on but in the same all that you have done should be seen as your material, and with it the ability to reuse.  Hear me out.  How about we dust off the old landlord skit?  I loved it. And the dollar. And maybe we even bring arnold back. We add a few laugh tracks, and you got a new video!! No need to thank me, but you can.  I wont get mad big boy.",

        "i've found this is true for a lot of chronic illness products as well\u2014 it can be more material to track, but when you're dealing with pain that fluctuates from minute to minute, let alone day by day, it becomes hard to register what's helping and what's not. the idea of something being \"medically useful\" has become another avenue of the human experience for businesses to exploit instead of focusing their wealth on actively helping people. great video, drew, thank you for calling to attention how many people get scammed in an attempt to just make their lives a little more bearable.",

        "The mendi thing honestly reminds me of a toy I begged my parents to get me as a kid. You put on the headset, and it connected to this thing with fans and a ball. The idea was, if you thought hard enough, the fans would blow harder and make the ball go higher. And you had obstacle courses to set up to practice. Idk how it worked, if it was just random when the ball rose, but I thought for sure I would be apart of the X-men if I mastered it",

        "I think you might be getting panic attacks and anxiety attacks mixed up, they are often used interchangably but they are very different. The really bad attack you had sounds like a panic attack because you had a variety of physical symptoms (in order to be having a panic attack you need to have 3 or more of certain physical symptoms) but its possible the other attacks you had coulsve been anxiety attacks and thats why the other attack was so much worse.",

        "the fact that you have to charge all of those devices would make me 300x more anxious",
        "When i was learning how to play flute we sometimes used to practise with a plastic tube with ping-pong ball inside. You had to keep ball floating in the tube for as long as you could to enhance your lung capacity. It costs about 15$ i think, and I always found it really rellaxing. I believe it could work similar to this 200$ device Drew bought and you could pretty much diy something like this.",

I got it for my epilepsy, but it works for a number of different things including sleep and mood disorders. Being advertised on Instagram definitely feels sketch, understandably. Ironically, that's the one I trust the most.",

        "no i was watching",
        "Now that we're talking about actual things that work. The Oura ring is very highly touted smart device to track activity, hr , Blood Oxygen levels , and sleep. It's worth the price tag imo. Linus Sebastian from LTT really fights for the ring. Even though the company got angry he mispronounced the company name numerous times (funny) , but its byfar a non distracting device to help you  with your day to day activities. No I wasn't paid, I just like the device.",

        "The brainwave tracking is actually a ver useful tool. In hospitals you can get a more in-depth one to check for seizures and things called an EEG. Its a lot harder to scale this type of study down to commercial use because of how those tests are done, with strobe lights and probably 20-30 electrodes put on the brain with very expensive algorithms monitoring all the different brainwave patterns. But nonetheless these tests are done to track seizures, propensity of seizures, sleep issues and narcolepsy as well as many others. ",

        "Interoception is absolutely a thing.\n\nI know, because mine has always been garbage, but has actually improved with medication. Which is useful, because it's the sense that tells you about stuff like hunger, or needing to use the bathroom.",
        "Cyberpunk: chapter one",
        "the honesty about your panic attacks was really refreshing, Drew. I've been having intense and very traumatising panic attacks almost daily for nearly two years now after only having them rarely before then and it feels very lonely, so thank you for speaking on it so publicly. I hope it helps others to know it's ok for our brains to be broken<3",

        "OMG ITS NINJA",
        "Calmigo actually works really well. As someone who has a panic disorder I use it when I\u2019m in a panic headspace in order to focus on breathing. It helps you time your breathing and gives you something outside of your mind to pay attention to. It is a bit expensive but I truly think it\u2019s worth it.",
        "hey Drew, I\u2019m sorry to hear about your anxiety. I have it too. It probably means nothing to you but knowing that even big content creators and celebrities experience these feelings and issues makes people like me feel less alone in this world and is enough to keep us going. \u2018if others can, so can I\u2019 that kinda thing",

        "Hey drew, glad you\u2019re doing better after your panic attack. I struggle with horrible anxiety and depression as well and in case you\u2019re not already, recommend going on meds for it. Made a world of difference and is not a quick fix like any product advertising themself to be. You\u2019re not alone friend!",
        "I didnt realise until watching this video that mental health can be treated as an illness rather than a quirk... I always thought my lack of motivation stemmed from laziness rather than depression, and I thought my panic attacks occurred only because I was a fucking coward.",
        "Hoping things get easier for you soon, Drew. Even with therapy, I used to have panic attacks so bad that I thought I was dying as well. That and many other disorders got so bad it was eventually start taking meds or giving up life entirely. I may take 13 different medications, but I'm the best I've ever been. And getting better every day. Hoping you can get there too.",
        "I noticed you talked about not 'seeing' how it works (pulse waves and emf's are used) and how they would benefit someone. The same concept can be applied in reverse - we also don't 'see' harmful pulses and waves that give us shee like restless leg syndrome - so, the diseased population may be proof of harmful invisible waves...should we not buy into a 'fix' or harmonic resetting with helpful waves??? - Who TF knows...but you also mentioned placebo...sometimes you just preach straight from my head. Also- I'm putting a bid in for your oldest subscriber!",
        "Turn the mindi off, and that ball app will do the EXACT SAME THING. Because there\u2019s no way to measure concentration.",
        "Say what you will Drew, but these things genuinely made me feel smarter. I bought one for hundreds of dollars, wore it daily, and then finally had the brainpower and motivation to realize I'd been scammed.",
        "friendly reminder that for online scientific journals, they almost always list the names and contact info of the author(s) (it's often required of the authors to include it as part of publication), and most authors are more than happy to send you a copy of their research publication if you ask politely. they don't make money from the journals' access fees. did this awhile back for a research project and the author sent me the study I'd requested as well as two other publications she'd co-authored with additional info on the topic.",
        "You are the only person I watch ads for. You seriously make them all incredible.",
        "The screen that just says \u201cPain Control\u201d at 25:31 made me laugh so hard  what does that mean?? Why does it sound so threatening?? Also, am I the only one who thinks the blue and brown hair looks good?",
        "I may not have had that exact little pebble thing that vibrates on your chest, but what I do have is cats who sometimes sit on my chest and purr when I'm laying down. And I can confirm it's 10/10 depression cured (until you have to get up and do something, or the cat gets too heavy and you can't breathe properly, in which case it's maybe a 9.5/10)",

Full on animated mouths, chock full of plot holes (including treats that make dogs talk), and starring the dad from alone for Christmas as the dad in pup star. Drew NEEDS to react to it",
        "Drew is looking for anything to help him cope at this point",
        "hey andrew, nice vid",
        "Si I just wanted to shed some light on the whole research paywall thing. Most psychological studies are hidden behind a paywall. Typically when you're in university or something the university pays for a license to use and view that study and distributes it to students. The reason they do this is so that the people who conducted the study can actually make some money to fund further research. However, usually these people aren't also selling a product, so this particular one is dumb, but research being behind a paywall is actually very common.",
        "why does drew sound strangely like andrew glouberman\nalls im saying, ive never seen them in the same room at once",
        "Holy shit, the calmigo chick is the one who completely fabricated her whole career.",
        "I work at a large research university, so I found the Toward Emotional Prosthetics article Drew mentioned at 17:26. The journal it's coming from looks like it's been around for a while, so that's one thing in its favor (there's a huge problem in academia where fake journals target professors who need their articles published, take their money, and never publish anything). I can't share it for copyright reasons, but it's super short and has literally no numbers in it, using words like \"most\" or \"majority\" instead of exact numbers. Most of the other studies next to it include at least an exact percentage of subjects who performed/felt a certain way and some correlation statistics, but the Apollo article is totally devoid of numbers. It's super vague and like Drew said, there were only 38 participants. The methodology is also super vague. It talks about the tasks the participants performed, but it doesn't go into detail of how they measured participants before and after. Super suspicious all around as someone who read the article",
        "He should really troll us with a product that doesn\u2019t exist",
        "The fact that he thinks they want to help anybody is so sweet. The reason they're priced so high is so they can make as much money as possible before somebody cracks down on their bs.",

Hunger, thirst, racing heart, tiredness etc. Often people who are oversensitive to this sense, experience symptoms of anxiety as your brain misinterprets the physiological discomfort as you are in danger.

Other senses not often taught are proprioception (knowing where your body is in space) and vestibular (your sense of balance/ knowing how your head is moving against gravity).",
