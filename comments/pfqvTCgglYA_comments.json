        "I'm in a Starbucks Veranda phase right now",
        "Don't care for coffee that has that donut shop taste. I'm a Starbucks  Verona fan but have had Seattle's Best, and Peet's and they are a favorite too.\n\nI don't know what the big deal with Dunkin, I would have McDonald's before I have a cup of Dunkin.",
        "Trader Joe\u2019s, a smaller novelty grocery store has many, many coffees, which I think are mostly theirs. I would love to see you do taste testing on those! I enjoyed this taste test. Thanks!",
        "My favorite is Seattle's Best.",
        "Interesting that so many fast food branded options made it as far as they did. I imagine it's also not a coincidence that the winner was the only one bought as whole bean.",
        "I buy Silken Splendor regularly and it's quite nice.  If you like Philz Coffee and enjoy dark roasts as well, I really recommend Jacob's Wonderbar.",
        "As a Cafe Bustelo fan I wonder if the vacuum sealed brick would\u2019ve made it further than the tub ",
        "I love coffee, I\u2019ve been brought up on instant though. I\u2019m always on the lookout for a better brew but I have to be honest, I have never enjoyed any pod coffee as much as instant and I\u2019ve probably tried about 10 types of cafeti\u00e8re coffees and didn\u2019t think a single one of them tasted better than instant either.",
        "You've never had Folgers? How? I find that almost impossible to believe.",
        "I'm not offended at all, especially since you've been so tactful about it\n\nI'm relieved because I love coffee but can't enjoy drinking most of it and feel like I'm being a baby. I make the exact same faces and even say things like \"it tastes empty\" and people think I'm weird (i don't say that about their coffee lol)",
        "having lived on the west coast of the US, I can honestly say I wasn't surprised Philz Coffee made it so far",
        "Eight O' Clock is typically a good supermarket coffee. I refuse to buy preground and it's one of the few brands you can still get in the grocery store as whole beans.\n\nAnd ALL Starbucks coffee is nasty. Never had a brand of theirs that didn't taste like burnt hair. Have to drown it in creamer just to get it down.",
        "The slurping is so distracting. Really?",
        "Not surprised by the Tim Hortons/Dunkin/McDonalds compliments in the tastings.  They're far more likely let down in the preparation in the stores being drip-style commercial brewers.  i can easily imagine if done in smaller batches, more carefully, they'd perform better.",
        "The Starbucks Veranda Blend is my favorite of the brands you tried, and I have tried most of them. It's got a flavor that I can't find in any store bought coffee. Also it doesn't show any characteristics of unripe beans like many store brands have. I actually quite enjoy the McCafe, which totally surprised me, and the Dunkin' Doughnuts as well",
        "Would have been nice to see how those \"BULLETPROOF\" coffees (Dave Asprey's) and Trader Joe's Medium Roast stacked up against everything else...",
        "I don\u2019t even drink coffee, but I watched this.",
        "This was hilarious and rather enjoyable video. I got a kick of the reactions to all the brands I know. I share similar opinions. Thanks a bunch.",
        "I'm a Folgers drinker and I can't drink anything else",
        "It would definitely be interesting to see matchups of the different \"upscale\" grocery store brands from across the US. Where I live in California, Stumptown, Intellegentsia, Ritual, and a few others are readily available at Whole Foods and other overpriced grocery stores. Those vs similarly marketed brands in, say, Chicago, would be fun to see.",
        "I have been drinking Peet\u2019s Coffee Major Dickason\u2019s dark roast exclusively for 2 years now. The first coffee I tasted where I actually enjoyed the taste of the coffee and didn\u2019t feel the need to drown it with my oatmilk creamer. Highly recommend to everyone. M",
        "Is it not possible to put the liquid in your mouth without a very pronounced slurp? Does doing it that way <<increase>> the flavor?",
        "This video was brought to you by Tim Hortons coffee...",
        "To address the Philz controversy: I didn\u2019t realise they weren\u2019t widely available. It was heavily suggested in the Patreon poll to pick the coffees, so I presumed it had decent distinction US-wide. My apologies! I also don\u2019t think I understood the massive grocery variation by region (coming from a small island). Feel free to pick your own winner from the top 4! Regardless - I hope this was a fun video!",
        "Would be interesting to see this done again after mixing up the order to see if head to head comparisons had any impact\u2026",
        "Tim Hortons \"in the restaurant\" coffee can be really hit or miss. Sometimes I'll go and it's pretty good, sometimes I'll go and I can't drink it at all... Like something sour got into it or something. Brewed at home is much better.",
        "Maxwell house is what I drink but always the Colombian. I don't drink it black but I think it tastes pretty good, like chocolate.",
        "Does anyone see what's wrong with this video?? If you don't...... here's a clue, they drink tea.......",
        "No one:\nJames: I'm going to put this one through for just being a bit weird\n\nJames giving life lessons! I have so much love and respect for you! \ufe0f",
        "Lavazza Gran Aroma has to be the best option",
        "The fact that he calls Tim's friendly at the end is just so Canada haha",
        "Can you do one but for UK coffees?",
        "That sipping noise tho",
        "It\u2019s so funny that you described Tim Horton as \u201cfriendly\u201d multiple times! James, maybe you could do a world tour of grocery coffee.",
        "best for espresso not cappuccino",
        "Comparative tasting and the bracket system was awesome. I\u2019d like to see commercially available vs top shelf blind comparisons.",
        "Dear James, \nReally liked your efforts on this video. If you get a chance to travel to the USA in the near future and you are flying on Southwest airlines, they serve Community Coffee. Best I have had of airplane coffee. Philz winning is interesting, too. My nephew turned me on to Philz. I am surprised at Philz now being nationally distributed.  Anyway great video! I roast coffee as a Farmer's market seller using propane hot air ( fluid bed) roasters and have had some success with it. You are an inspiration.",
        "James, if its even possible I'll happily ship you out a heap of Australian coffee brands hahaha",
        "Tesora from Philz that was dropped in the 1st round is my favorite.",
        "What watch are you wearing?",
        "Lavazza?",
        "Wtf is with the sipping? Is he a 90yr old with no teeth or something?",
        "I am a Community Coffee & Chicory fan - and I drink it with milk and sweetener.  I appreciate James\u2019 honesty in preferring lighter roast. \n\nI would love to prefer black coffee. Do you, James and subscribers, think that drinking lighter roasts allows for a \u201ccream and sugar\u201d lover to start drinking black?",
        "Really surprised to see Timmies being available in the US; didn't realize it made it down there. Also, interesting to see that he felt like Tim's and McDonald's were so close since the two of them share common grounds (lol). For a long time, Tim's coffee was supplied by Mother Parkers before they opened up to do their own roasting and supplying. After that, McDonald's Canada switched over to Mother Parkers and rumour is that McD's had MP create a blend as similar to the old Tim's recipe as possible. Obviously MP didn't know the exact recipe but they'd worked with Tim's long enough to put together a decent clone",
        "Finns drink a lot of coffee. Maybe try theirs?",
        "I'm glad to see Peet's as a recommended dark roast. It's fast become one of my favorites along with Seattle's Best. This video definitely makes me want to try Dunkin's and Tim Horton's at the store when I get a chance. I would like to say though that pretty much all of the coffees you mentioned taste much better at home than at a cafe. I'd love to see your opinion on coffee from Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf as well as Klatch Coffee - two popular chains here in Southern California. I'm sure there are tons of other ones in other parts of the country that deserve attention as well.",
        "Now that you did a round of grocery store coffee, do a round of online subscription based coffees!",
        "Next generation of parents be like:",
        "\u201cNice vegetable soup with a twist of lemon\u201d never thought I\u2019d hear that as a description of a coffee taste profile lol. I wont lie, I HATE Dunkin, folgers, maxwell house etc, Im a bit disappointed he didn\u2019t like Cafe Bustello, thats my go to cheap coffee to use in my kurig pod, If I cant get my local roastery\u2019s french roast beans for my french press, literally tastes like dark chocolateBut I use a couple tablespoons of heavy cream in my coffee, I cant do black so I understand his preference for the light fruity ones. Maybe I\u2019ll try some of that Philz stuff, I do think the fact that it was freshly ground created some bias though. I appreciate the professional perspective ",
        "Um i expected an actual grocery store brand review :( i drink Great Value French roast .. None of these here are store brands",
        "You might find it interesting that Tim Hortons and McCafe are roasted by the same company. The husband of one of my coworkers is the district manager for Tim Hortons in Western New York and used to be the same for McDonald's just north in Ontario and she brought this up in a previous conversation about coffee. I greatly enjoyed this video!",
        "You missed the light roast McDonald\u2019s breakfast blend. One of the better coffee grounds you can find in most grocery stores.",
        "Walmart brand is ok for the money.",
        "McCafe has become an existential threat to James",
        "i think it'd be interesting to try specifically store brand coffee, coffee specifically branded to that grocery store. being in texas, we have HEB, which has their own coffee brand and i assume that might be the case for other grocery chains? i am not a fan of cafe ole but it might be fun to find out who's store brand coffee is the least terrible heheh.",
        "Philz is the reason I have become a weird coffee person. They are more known for their mixed coffee drinks, but they do a pour over for every drink in their cafes and list the flavor profiles of all their roasts.",
        "Philz is very fancy/expensive for grocery store tier coffee. I love going to Philz tho - my favorite is the Ambrosia of Coffee God which is a light roast coffee. Their more popular roasts are the Jacob's Wonderbar and Tesora. And if you're at their coffee bar, the mint mojito is a must try signature latte ",
        "I have tried most of your picks, still prefer Peet's over the others. I mostly order online from specialty shops. nice video! thanks again.",
        "His face after every slurp is gold LOL",
        "To be fair, Cafe du monde is meant to be drank with milk",
        "The best American store coffee\u2026.was nearly Canadian coffee hahahahahha",
        "Dunkin is usually available as whole beans at most grocery stores where I live and it goes on sale quite a bit. Solid choice when trying to save money or just want something simple.",
        "As a peets fan the French roast is a lot smoother and more palatable than major Dickson's. I prefer the Sumatra but that seems to be a roast to order bag only now",
        "i find it so fascinating that major brands like dunkin, starbucks, and tim hortons ended up with favorable results throughout the video. they all made it pretty far and had recommendations at the end for the best coffee at each roast level",
        "Wow know I know why my coffee of today doesn't taste like it did fort years ago .\nWhat brand do you recommend .\nI miss coffee that was good .\nThanks for doing this . Not easy .",
        "This is a good idea going into the holiday season, because I always get stuck brewing coffee for all of our family and sometimes depending on the town we're in there isn't good stuff available and if I run out of what I brought with me I have to get something from grocery stores. I often go with community coffee or Dunkin knowing that they are not as dark and more interesting cups than a lot of the others and generally widely available. I think it would be a cool video series to even hit up store brands that are more specific to locations, like Aldi.",
        "Ah the Maxwell House ground coffee, I loaded it in my el cheapo coffee maker and smells so good, and I drank it, was cranked for 2 days.",
        "Sorry this was botched - you can\u2019t compare pre-ground coffee to fresh ground!  You simply proved what should be well known that fresh ground is the only way to go",
        "I'd love to see you do a rank of all of them. The bracket style makes me think that things get missed",
        "I came just to see what you thought of Cafe Bustelo. It is a favorite among Caribbean Latinos and I will admit it is quite strong so an acquired taste. Thanks for including it!",
        "How can you do this experiment without trying HEB coffee? I'm appalled.",
        "I died a little inside every time you had praise for Community Coffee.  My flavor profile of choice leans hard toward stronger roasts like Cafe Bustelo and Cafe El Moro.  I consider Folgers to be the Bic Pen of coffee, cheap, readily available, and it gets the job done and probably the best overall bang for your buck.",
        "Fun thing about the \"G\u00ebvalia\" one: Gevalia is a Swedish brand, and the name \"Gevalia\" is the latin translation of the city they come from, \"G\u00e4vle\". In the US, someone decided to pretty recently re-design the packaging (or if it was newly introduced even), and to make it look more Swedish, they put two dots somewhere.. like.. over the e. Which isn't a letter in the Swedish alphabet, but okay. ",
        "Folgers Black Silk",
        "LOL .. this was fun to watch.  You need to get some A&W coffee so you can yell NO immediately.",
        "Been watching your channel for about a week. In that time I've spent over $300 on coffee paraphernalia. I'm not sure I can afford to keep watching",
        "I couldn't fine eight o'clock coffee review?",
        "Timmys beating Dunks. Canadians rejoice",
        "James, I followed on facebook but now i'm subbing to your YT. I don't drink coffee, at all, but your content is thoroughly enjoyable and interesting, even to a non coffee drinker.",
        "I'm as much of a snob as the next person, and I have my single origin favorites, but regular Folgers is a guilty pleasure for me.  There's no reason I should like it, but I really am happy to drink a cup.  Their breakfast blend, even moreso.",
        "It may be worthwhile to run this test again with whole bean coffee to see if the results are similar.",
        "Does caffeine effect you at all?",
        "Bustelo harsh and bitter?! I\u2019m out! Lol",
        "As an American I was definitely nodding along with your assessments on those coffees (I've had almost all of them).  I think if you're going to explore more into coffees available in American stores, you should contact Trader Joe's and have them send you a selection of their coffees.  They are the \"best of the budget brands\" in my opinion.  I would suspect that Trader Joes (TJ's) would even offer to send you the coffee for free if you did a review of just their varieties.",
        "I would have been interested to see what you thought of the Private Selection coffees offered by the Kroger company. They make several whole bean coffees that I've enjoyed: Sumatran Mandheling, Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, and Guatemalan Antiguan.",
        "As a Canadian, I am both proud and confused. My reaction was much the same as James' here- Tim Hortons coffee is not good, but maybe that is more the prep at their locations. Fun video!",
        "Too bad Lavazza wasnt included, I just brought a bunch back from Milan last month.",
        "Great vid my wife and I fell in love with philz out in Cali. Great coffee!!!",
        "Let's see a flavored bag coffee head to head.  I'd like to see James wince at everything.",
        "We always use Dunkin Original. It\u2019s so good compared to all the other brands I\u2019ve tried.",
        "13:02 Results of the War of 1812 (part 2) just dropped",
        "Funny thing was watching his vids i realized i never had a proper cup of coffee, all been instant and Costa ....i really must try one at a proper coffee cafe",
        "I'd say of common ground coffee blends; USA \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 I'd taste test, try; Boyd's of Or. Stumptown, OR blend, Cameron's, Community Vanilla Waffle Cone. I also like online, veteran owned  coffee choices like Blackout Coffee, Three Rivers Coffee Co, Trident Coffee \ufe0f, Old Salt Coffee , Fire Dept Coffee , Alpha Coffee . Some enjoy Black Rifle Coffee but they've had some \"drama\" & issues.  Evan Hafer, the ex CIA-SAD guy who's CEO has turned many people away....",
        "I've tried peets before when I couldn't get the local stuff I usually buy and it wasn't bad.",
        "I did not see French Market. Therefor this video is not worth my time.",
        "I would have loved Aldi's coffee to be included here as it's the most affordable I can get near me.",
        "What I could really use here in the US is a method of reverse engineering each brand's \"Best by...\" date to figure out the actual roast date. Whenever I'm at the store, I can check which bag of the same coffee is freshest or at least not select the one bag that's been on the shelf longest. But I don't know whether I can compare freshness between two brands. I have no reason to be certain they each set the date the same amount of time forward from the roast.",
        "Gevalia: for those curious what the mud and grass that's been wedged in their shoes after cutting the lawn last season could add to their over-roasted, ashy 3-year-old pre-ground coffee.",
        "Coffee is exclusively a matter of personal preference.",
        "How about Costco brand?",
        "Aldi (yes I know it's a German chain but they're in the US too) and Kroger both have good store brands imo. \nI've been really enjoying Kroger's private selection coffee for what it is (especially once you consider its price). \nWould love to have seen how they stacked up.",
        "Regular! Yes, a vote for making this a regular segment Very fun, but informative too. I\u2019m so curious about the winner \u2014 I\u2019ve never heard of it.\n\nIs it true that light roasts have/result in the most caffeine?",
        "I love Community Coffee Decaf ( I have a heart arrhythmia, don't yell at me for my decaf love LOL!!) it's fantastic also as iced coffee! :-) Funny thing also is Tim Horton's (another of my faves) is Canadian. But you should try the Cafe Special Decaf Medium/Dark Roast by Community Coffee, IMHO it's better than the American blend and a good full flavor for iced coffee.",
        "As a worker for one of the major coffee brands here I've been hoping James would talk about it more. I love the coffee we have and we even do tastings in store so we can understand our own coffee better but we never really talk about our coffee vs other coffee so I've been wanting a more expert opinion about it for a while.",
        "Kinda funny seeing Dunkin vs Tims near the end. I have a cannister of Bustelo but I only use it for making a cuban coffee in a moka pot and the recipe involves plenty of sugar. I would assume Cafe du Monde is a similar thing, people might use it for Vietnamese coffee with condensed milk. Growing up my mom always had the choc full o nuts so that probably is more nostalgic for me.",
        "Im a huge fan of Seattles best brand, I got 'hooked' on their hazelnut back when that was my thing. Now days I go for whatever they've got at my local shop. Its a good cup of coffee for sure",
        "I'm widely unfamiliar with a lot of these brand roasts because I stick with my core few. That said, if you do another grocer brand taste test, I put forth Lavazza Gran Selizione, Gloria Jean, and Door County Coffee.",
        "I\u2019m not a sophisticated coffee drinker, but I drink it black and prefer light to medium roast. Whenever I\u2019m traveling and grab a quick convenient cup of McCafe, from the drive through, I find myself surprised about half way through and muttering \u201cnot a bad cup of coffee\u201d. I have been mocked by others for sharing this, but watching the McCafe get mildly positive feedback was hugely satisfying and weirdly therapeutic for me.",
        "Now I have to try Cafe de Monde since I like everything this guy hates",
        "i think including the espresso coffee was a mistake and unfair comparison.  the process to make espresso ground and the coffee making to be served is not the same.  Espresso is thicker and more intense than coffee because of the lower grounds to water ratio, the finer grind, and the pressurized brewing method. Regular coffee uses a coarser grind, more water and gravity to extract the final brew.  maybe it would better time served in comparing the different brands of espresso ground coffees from gorcery stores.  if you chose not to use the espresso machine in favor of the drip method the experience will be different.  maybe have this same comparison between espresso brands using and not using the machine to compare experiences.",
        "I think this highlights the issue i normally have if I'm buying coffee at the store: everything is medium to dark roast, probably 90%.  Trying to find a light roast is rough, and the veranda  is usually what i end up with",
        "I can't believe my \"everyday coffee\" did so well. Proud Canadian here watching Tim Hortons do so well!",
        "From a misophonia sufferer, THANK YOU for the accurate captions. I unmuted for \"I hope you have a great day\" of course, but otherwise this had to be sound-off for me and the captions were great!",
        "Coffee and chicory is usually drank in the south 'cafe au lait'  or vietnamese style, so even people who like it wouldn't drink it black.",
        "Are these tasted hot or cold?",
        "Why wouldn\u2019t you have separate spoons for tasting? Or at least clean off the spoon between tests? I saw multiple drops hanging on the bottom of the spoon from the first test that were slurped up after the second. Wouldn\u2019t that alter the taste of the second coffee every time?",
        "First off, maxwell and folgers should not even be counted as its pencil shavings posing as coffee. Secondly you should include Nabob and Edwards coffee.",
        "Buy local roasted coffee or your favorite shop you went to on vacation",
        "Ready?  \n\nSBC (Seattle's Best Coffee) was beating Starbucks before Starbucks managed to get enough capital to buy them out and bury the brand.  They had more stores across the USA than Starbucks.  Starbucks was a more bitter dark roast while SBC specialized more in a medium roast.  You tested a dark roast version of SBC (Post Alley is a location in the city of Seattle) - much more like Starbucks than how SBC was.",
        "I'm kind of amazed at how well the Dunkin' Donuts coffee fared, since to me it's horrendous and un-drinkable, and represents the worst of what brutally sour, highly acidic light roast is.   Hearing it called 'complex' is strange.",
        "As a Canadian who spends lots of time in San Francisco I am excited with the results. I've met Phil (Jaber) many times at his joint on 24th near Van Ness, Mission district and simply love his brews. Tim Horton is part of our Canadian social fabric... Good work James Hoffman.",
        "7:47 - Staggering similar cups of coffee. Definitely a compliment as that's 8 oclock is half the price of the Starbucks. :D I wish you had kept the prices up past the 1st round.",
        "I think for first round you should have eliminated any that were undrinkable straight away instead of letting the better of two move on. Some potential good ones may have been cut in the first round while others you don't like edged by",
        "Takeaway:  Over-roasted coffee is gross. Stop burning it to hide the fact that it's robusto, **Starbucks**.  Thirty years of that and now nearly every coffee producer over-roasts their beans to match, and it's disgusting.",
        "What can I say? Other than each to his own. I love Dark thick coffee. Petes Dark French Roast is awesome, but of late I have been enjoying Cafe du Monde and Comunity\u2019s Coffee/Chicory blend. Yep, Dark Roasts for me.",
        "Try grocery store iced coffee next!",
        "I enjoy the side content mixed in with the main story. It's a nice break that allows for more development in a sense.",
        "Love this! Please make it a regular feature. Would also recommend putting some of the products from Trader Joe\u2019s in the mix too!",
        "I'm curious as to what coffee you would give high marks to, that could be purchased online so we could all taste it too. Would be fun!\n\nI'm also curious if you've ever tried Choffy or similar brand and your thoughts on that.",
        "Although Starbucks is my personal favorite, especially the dark roasts, I am a big fan of Tim Horton\u2019s and Community Coffee. Both offer a nice cup of Joe. Community Coffee has been readily available in my area for some time. Tom Horton\u2019s has recently been appearing at our local Target. Prior to that, I had to search for it in random places or it was purchased out of town.",
        "Chuckled pretty good on round 2 when he said \u201cSurprised you made it through\u201d to Cafe Bustelo ",
        "Not even going to listen to this Jews opinion.",
        "Why is he sipping it like that?",
        "Were you able to sleep the night of this video?",
        "Seeing that Tim Hortons coffee as apart of a American selection still doesnt sit right. We have no spine..",
        "It might be interesting to do a review of major brand espresso beans iike illy, Lavazza, etc",
        "I've always liked Cafe Bustelo because it's such a strong dark coffee",
        "Is the Caribou coffee from Grocery Outlet? I'm not familiar with it, but feel like I may have seen it there. Never seen Tim Horton's before and I'm on the west coast, USA. Isn't it a Canadian chain? Only time I've seen Chock Full O'Nuts was one time at Grocery Outlet about 10 years ago. I think it was $4.99. Had never heard of it before. It's weird that Dunkin' sells their coffee on the west coast, but have no stores here. The only one I was aware of was probably 15+ years ago in Clackamas Oregon.",
        "Tim Hortons is the real winner here! the best cheap coffee!!! just got a medium double double at tims <3",
        "I always have to brew a fresh cup of coffee to watch a new Hoffmann video",
        "Local prices (USD): Philz Silken Splendor = $19.50/lb. Tim Horton's Original Blend = $8/lb. Starbucks Veranda = $12/lb. Peet's Major D = $16/lb.",
        "I was a barista for a couple of years at Philz. They trained us to push Tesora on new customers, but I always recommended Silken Splendor instead. Looks like my personal taste checked out!",
        "I'd love to see you do this with German brands, but that would perhaps be a bit too niche for the majority of your viewers.",
        "Worked at Philz for 5 years and can definitely say that the coffee is different. Each blend of coffee has 2-7 roasts of beans all sourced from around the world. Each bean is roasted to the correct profile and then blended together creating each unique coffee blend. When visiting a store you are presented with a very full-bodied cup of coffee that is crafted one cup at a time via a special Philz version of pour over.",
        "In fairness, in the past two places I\u2019ve lived (DC and San Diego) it\u2019s been very common to find proper third wave coffee in stores like Whole Foods, Giant and Ralph\u2019s. Tragically, they\u2019re almost never fresh \n\nSuper interesting video! Surprising (and genuinely humbling to those of us working in third wave coffee) to hear how many good things you actually had to say about these when you didn\u2019t know what they were. You make a good point about relativity as well.",

Peet's would be the next tier, then Starbucks, with others undrinkable. Philz has a good rep but I've never tried it.

Most/many of us here (including myself) like the idea of 4th wave specialty coffee, and likely dabble in better quality brewing and beans, but for various reasons (proximity to anyone roasting that kind of deliciousness) we are most familiar with these brands. Also, many of the roasters I know of and frequent are \"forced\" to roast for the palette of people who like and are used to these sorts of coffees. It's a self reinforcing cycle, which isn't a bad thing, it's just what it is. ",

One thing I've figured out after living in Europe for seven years is that Americans tend to make coffee weaker at home. Most of our machines' baskets aren't even big enough for the amount of grounds to go with the number of cups in the carafe. It's not even possible to make coffee the way they do in Europe. That weaker brew mellows out the bitters at lot. This also drives us to go with stronger, darker grounds to get ANY flavor profile at all.

I have a high end Mr Coffee that has a head about  2 1/2 inches imperial diameter. When you brew coffee in it surprisingly it is better. My daily use Cusinart has a large sprinkler head but also seems to control temperature of the brew cycle better. Both do only a marginal job against professional set ups.

        "I like Gevalia.",
        "Ooo I see Caribou in there! ",
        "As a Canadian, I am as gobsmacked as you are that anything Tim Horton's made it that far. Wow!",
        "Now do Canada!",
        "It'd be interesting to compare the different light roasts, medium and dark roasts that coffee shops have to offer, like Starbucks. I've always liked their blond roast",
        "Not missing anything at Timmy ho hos.  Trash coffee. Astouding that the grocery store version beat out some of those others.",
        "I\u2019m really just happy I live near-ish a Target that carries Blue Bottle.",
        "The cringe of every Canadian watching when he called Tim\u2019s \u201cAmerican\u201d was palpable",
        "I laughed my ass off at the thought of the Tim Horton's winning and James sticking the American flag next to it at the end",
        "It's Lavazza. Fight me.",
        "(designer here) it\u2019s remarkable how the less good coffee also has less good package design (yes i am aware how subject that is), but i\u2019m a designer so\u2026i\u2019m right :)",
        "Could you please make a video on Black Rifle Coffee Company? I like their coffee, but I want to make sure it\u2019s not a placebo thing and I\u2019m actually getting good beans.",
        "I would definitely like to see you  try whole bean versions of grocery store coffees. Some coffees I dont normally like as ground either but the whole bean does taste a but different from some of those brands",
        "I just had my first Philz coffee at a Philz coffee shop in California and it was one of the best cups of coffee I've ever had!  It was Tesora blend.  My wife's coffee of a different blend was not nearly as tasty.  Also, expensive as each cup is carefully brewed as a pourover by a barista.",
        "That moment when you realize you are having a great time watching... a reaction video. ",
        "Been a Peet\u2019s fan for several years. Medium roast\u2026Cafe Domingo",
        "Ok, but why did Dunks do okay, but is quite sad in-store? Am I ordering the wrong thing? Someone, please educate me.",
        "The American coffee palate is burnt and bitter. Vestige of cowboy cups. \"Puts hair on your chest and a pep in your step\". Sweeten with hair of the dog",
        "Tims easily has the worst coffee (here in Canada) when you don't brew it your self. None of my coworkers like it either. I think it tends to be convenience that keeps people going back...there is almost a tims at every other corner.",
        "Where does COFFEE, INSTANT, TYPE 2 rank? I hear it's the best!",
        "Well James and I have common ground on chicory. Blagh! Yes, the US is a big place* and there is variations across the country. I'm also convinced that who buys the beans, where they are processed, how they are handled during process is going to change even within a brand. In short you can buy the same brand consistently but it will fluctuate in taste, even dramatically.",
        "Slurping=gets ya a slapping",
        "I would love to see some videos on Q grading and how one acquires it. Elevation and why coffees above 1600 masl are what they are. Also, a video on types of roasters such as air, hybrid, gas drum, etc. All things I love to nerd out about so I am sure others would enjoy them as well. \nCheers!",
        "It's not the brand.  It's the age of the beans.  I've bought the same brand several times and each time it tastes differently\u2014basically from how long it happened to have been in a warehouse or sitting on the shelf.  Coffee beans can be as old as ten years old, and as fresh as recent.  Advertising and marketing practices have got everyone barking up the wrong tree."
