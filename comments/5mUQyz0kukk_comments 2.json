I've seen scummy managers do this exact bs maneuver all the time to employees that they don't like; give them a completely unrealistic schedule, expect them to work insane overtime, only to berate them when they inevitably fail so that they can call them \"lazy\" and have an excuse to fire them. My heart sank when I read Mick's statement and saw this kind of abuse happening to him. When reading Marty's post vs Mick's it's clear to me who the real \"ball ache\" is. Marty's post reads exactly like a corporate rat who knows he holds all the power and can control the narrative with the help of his massive legal team.",
