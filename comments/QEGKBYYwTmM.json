Floyd was absolutely toying with Deji, bro was dancing cuz he knew he was getting the bag for doing nothing", "Deji such a humble guy, he didn't wanna embarrass Mayweather so he let him win and only gave him a black eye, what a guy.", "respect to Floyd for not knocking Deji out cold in the first round in front of his family and young fans.", "This technically was the longest deji has lasted during a fight  We\u2019ve never seen him last 6 rounds", "Big respect to Deji for letting his student use him as a punching bag. ", "I can\u2019t imagine how terrifying this match is from Deji\u2019s pov.", "It never ceases to amaze me how Floyd looks like he's doing a little but is actually doing alot!", "I couldn\u2019t fall back asleep this morning. This fight definitely helped.", "Big respect for the master boxer to stay humble and let the little guy gain experience. Deji letting Floyd win for his confidence is ", "Huge props to Deji for putting over young talent like Floyd.

Deji showed some maturity. He could have gone in with a hot head but he stood his ground against one of the greats and ended the fight ten toes down.

Usually in boxing, your speed, reflexes and timing are first to go with power being the last thing they have at his age.  I know deji and Logan paul are youtubers, but they are men half his age, naturally bigger, and in their physical prime but Floyd's speed and timing is still what separates him from them.", "How crazy this is, I\u2019m envious, Floyd gets to learn a lesson from the GOAT in a lil ole game I like to call boxing", "Floyd was trying to make deji last as long as he could!!", "I love seeing Floyd just out here having fun stacking it up!", "Bro this was a close fight had me on the edge of my seat", "Always a pleasure to watch the elite fighters even in their retirement.

That dance he did was hilarious! ", "Of course Deji was never gonna win, the chance was almost non existent. But props to Deji for doing what most have never done by given Floyd a shiner on his eye and making him bleed. You rarely see that. Especially in an exhibition. Regardless of the loss it\u2019s a win win for Deji. He gained valuable experience, and he\u2019s gonna have plenty more experience in his fights going forward now.", "He's gonna learn a lot from this. Imagine you had 6 rounds with one of the best boxers ever ?", "At the end of his career he can say he was beaten by two of the greats, Floyd Mayweather and Vinnie Hacker.", "It'd be weird if Deji thought he was in a real fight.", "For those who didn\u2019t notice\u2026 Floyd is 4 decades old now, so you can tell that he was feelin deji\u2019s punches (the few, the proud) deji showed a lot of defense but lacked just a bit of aggression. But then again Floyd is Floyd so it\u2019s understandable I guess.", "Deji before the fight basically even state that he knew he was going to get outboxed and that he stood no chance against Floyd, and that the whole reason he took this fight was to gain experience. The problem is, this was so much of a one-sided beatdown, that Deji pretty much gained nothing, and this was pretty much a big waste of everyone's time.", "That wasn\u2019t a fight that was just a trainer teaching his student nicely", "Mad respect for a \u201cYouTube boxer\u201d with the balls to face floyd", "Deji - the fight for his life \nMayweather - a lite Sunday spar session", "Imagine if Deji gave just a tad bit pressure\u2026man Floyd would\u2019ve gone night night!", "so sad i didn\u2019t know deji was even sick, anyone know how much time he has left? kind of think it\u2019s odd make a wish allowed him to fight mayweather instead of just meeting him", "A crazy thing is that mayweathers dad came to my uncles boxing training.

Well done", "I love how everyone remembered the last random roles and thought you were doing the same plan. Well you work you just did it in a different way!", "This was actually somewhat wholesome, Floyd knew he was fighting an amateur boxer, but he held back at times and then unleashed a little during certain stages. Just to keep the youngster humble. I'm sure if Floyd wanted to, he could easily knock deji out in the first round. But he entertained the crowd", "Honestly even if deji lost Mayweather gots the years to back him up and is using this fight to teach deji which is truly amazing", "One of the best things is that he never takes credit for himself when he achieves something.

Congrats on the KO Floyd and thanks for the entertainment", "Floyd showed a lot of respect in this he had no beef with deji and really was just showing him and teaching him rather than going crazy. That\u2019s love fr and deji did great held his own even though he was shaking but your going against one of the greatest so understandable. Floyd just trying to give the crowd a show and let deji get some experience watching him move and when he taunts him a little it\u2019s when deji is usually slightly out of range so I hope he noticed Floyd\u2019s standing and the way he\u2019s prepared to move out of the line of punches rather than blocking.", "Floyd ain\u2019t have to put it on him like that ", "Deji never unleashed on Floyd what a sweet heart \ufe0f ", "It's like watching someone's dad play fighting with their 10 year old son", "Floyd went into this match like a Harlem Globetrotter.

But Floyd, as the Defensive, sharper, Slicker & Quicker Boxer, it still wouldn\u2019t have ended well for deji but Respect for deji stepping in the ring with one of the all time Greats of boxing even though this was just an exhibition, Floyd still knows how to put on a show", "Greatest boxer ever has to be giving these guys these fights and a payday can finish whenever he wants just world class", "Out of all Floyd's opponents, none have given him such a stage to put on a performance of this calibre Weji's in the chat ", "Regardless of deji losing this was a interesting fight props to deji for stepping in the ring against Mayweather big dubs for both of them", "If Floyd's last 2 fights including this one counted he would be 52-0 right now, they should've counted those fights", "I remember when my older brother used to take it ez on me with sockem boppers back in the day. Floyd was having a ton of fun schooling Deji lol.", "This is literally when you\u2019re a level 1 in a game and fight the final boss in a game", "Watching Floyd in this fight is like watching Roy Jones", "What a humble guy, at any time deji could've tried", "Deji skipped straight to the boss fight lol, it looked like a fun time", "\u2018Its a bit early\u2019 was an understatement", "I mean Floyd coulda been cornered him like that way earlier in the first round..
