        "Man etho, what a bore-ing episode! Okay pun aside im glad to see this series back and I'm also intrigued to see how you handle recalling the tunnel bore to dock it for resources. It also gives me ideas for create, because I really want to try that mod but its always so daunting.",
        "I've been looking at all the other minecraft youtubers and its fuckin crazy that Etho is one of the few that still has a HUGE loyal fanbase. Lile VintageBeef's view count is terrible c ok considering he has almost 2 mil subs also I'm fairly certain he had over 2 mil earlier this year not sure though. Just goes to show not asking for likes Nd subs gets you farther down the road cuz ppl are gunna watch and sub to ur channel if they enjoy it. Personally Etho is the only MC youtuber I watch anymore and I'll keep supporting him for as long as he uploads for",
        "whenever i watch modded videos from Etho i remember his sky islands. oh, the times...",
        "Comment for support!",
        "I like how he just ignored the question about what\u2019s the difference between a skillet and a frying pan",
        "I noticed the super glue is the older version of the Create mod which works a whole lot differently (now it uses a box pattern like world edit instead of placing single glue spots). If I remember correctly, each glue you place on a block acts as an entity and can cause lag when you use a lot of this glue! It is best to use mostly chassis that auto connect to each other without glue.",
        "Seeing you play with create and then seeing tango and co playing with create is so confusing because they are on the newer version.",
        "You could make it place a three wide cobblestone path or if possible make it place the entire 3 by 3 tunnel. This way it will be safer and you will use more cobblestone and have more room for other stuff in the storage.",
        "EPIC",
        "Hey Etho, glad to see you back on modded MC.\n\nJust wanted to say that you don't need to superglue everything in create mod. I believe you only need to glue drills, saws and chests because the structure itself is bound together. You can hold a wrench to see and adjust how many blocks are connected (by default it's 8).",
        "man etho always make even the best of days better",
        "Snack Streak 13: Not a snack but dinner, rotisserie chicken yum.\nCant believe we get the star from Cooking with Etho!!",
        "I love Etho!! <3",
        "Had a feeling it was going to drop today :D Delighted to actually see a youtuber use chassis blocks.",
        "Etho can we get a new version of the dusty dinner as a call back? Maybe something for enchanting like the dusty library?",
        "Those star swipes at the beginning are amazing",
        "If my math is correct, the train should be able to go 1152 blocks in one direction before it fills up with 6 barrels on it.",

        "Thank you Etho! I worry whenever you take longer than a week that you\u2019re burnt out again and quitting like what happened a few years back, I\u2019m so glad to see you sticking with it! I\u2019ve been watching you since middle school!",
        "When Etho said \"It actually kind of drifts\" I just heard the Tokyo  drift music in my head",
        "Etho - attach the chute directly to the contraption with a cobble filter and it will drain while running BEFORE it gets to the inventory",

        "I think we need a big racetrack for the turtle boats. Track your best times and such.",
        "Woohoo new Etho video. Definitely made my day seeing this. Thanks as always for the fun videos! <3",
        "You can use a funnel to spew cobblestone while in-flight, like you were trying to do with the smart chute\nI think there is an addon that allows Create contraptions to use stuff like storage drawers on contraptions",
        "I've always enjoyed watching you play modded, but only since learning to play it myself have I started to really understand and appreciate it!",
        "always love the goofy intros!",

        "Finally!",
        "In regards to the comment of the day: It is also 200k of our brains against 1 of your brain. You are a bit outnumbered. Don't worry we forget things too now and then ;)",
        "Etho you can punch the mine cart and the blocks will become no longer a contraption",

        "You're so lovable",
        "This video made me super hungry for a bowl of Turtle Flakes. ",
        "The turtlemancy stuff is v. v. weird but it's fun to watch you work through it. Reminds me of the Totemic mod you were working through in FoolCraft 3 with the Jingle Dress lol You danced and danced but couldn't master the hardest dances. Tbf I don't know how anyone could play 5 instruments at a time. Anyway, the turtle boat was worth it!",
        "Hi Etho, would you make a steampunk area in this series? I feel that the Create mod would be great for that sort of environment/theme",
        "Flyboys?? There's a series I haven't thought about in a while!",
        "been stressed out all morning. this just made it haha, thanks for bringing those chill vibes and funnys!! I hope everything is going well for you Etho, seems like we're all under a lot of stress right now",

        "Bdubs will be taking notes from this episode.",
        "I got in pretty deep into the create mod with a mod pack designed after yours. Some tips, the machines have no collision with the world or itself. So you can put a piece that places a cobble tunnel in every direction around the miner and have the drills right behind that part. This prevents water and lava issues. The inventory fills up fast. Create mod is very laggy. Build your main create factory in a place you don't want to be a main base.",

        "Why do so many modpacks etho plays have huge oceans? This one yeah, but also the terrafirmacraft/punk terrain tends to generate oceans in almost the same way that this one does (I know from experience after having to swim across them many times in search of death points",

        "hey new Etho video!",
        "my etho episodes bring me happiness every episode since highschool... 10years ago",
        "Hey etho will you play vintage story?",
        "Bro I haven\u2019t seen you in years holy cow",
        "the experimentation with that minecart drill is so amazing. absolutely makes me nostalgic for his older modded series and the problem solving he did with those",
        "Etho, have you ever seen Vintage Story? If you liked Terrafirmacraft you will l o v e this game.\nBasically it's Terrafirmacraft fully developed into its own standalone game with way more depth and the comfiest atmosphere possible, I like it more than I like Minecraft.",
        "I screeched at comment of the day. \n\nBeen watching for...years and years, never thought it would be my comment. ",
        "I was hoping ot be first",
        "Loved seeing both the fun editing and Cooking with Etho making a return! Great episode as always!",
        "it is so crazy to realize that Etho's voice has been somewhat of a constant throughout the years of his viewers growing up. I started watching Etho when I was either in 8th grade or my freshman year in high school. I'm 25 now.",
        "love the star wipe transition. so happy the goat is back in the kitchen.",
        "I'm getting flashbacks to a self boring train machine in some other modded series. Its been so long I don't even remember which.",

        "Thanks for the video, it was really fun.",
        "Call me crazy, but I think he was fired.",
        "Hi Etho, I hope you're well. I understand how you feel I've been playing Minecraft for years and forget things about it. Then someone shows me and I'm like... wait what? Loved this episode the Turtlemance looks really cool, what is your favourite mod so far in your modpack?",
        "Etho! Why not play with the hermits in create?  You're an amazing ytber, been watching you since forever! Keep up the great work, love your videos.",
        "ethoo :D",
        "etho. have you heard of the game vintage story? its like terrafirmiacraft but its own game and really cool!",
        "You can disable the rotation of the machine and make it lock on to one cardinal direction, that should make it a tiny bit more stable.",
        "Etho video means happiness :)",
        "Loved the star wipe transitions so much lol",
        "love you etho, you genuinely make my day, keep it up my king",
        "Not gonna lie I bursted out laughing on the playing catch bit ",
        "Crash Landing was the series that brought me to your channel way back in the day, and was my favorite series by you. Definitely more than an unimportant detail. That series is pure nostalgia to me.",
        "Love this series etho, good to see it again!",
        "I used to love cooking with etho! I watched the premeir every Wednesday morning with my family why I made his recipes!! I\u2019m so glad he decided to pursue a solo career!!!",
        "I have watched etho for I can\u2019t tell you how long and I\u2019ve never heard him panic like that",
        "The King has returned. \n\nActually he never went away. He's always been here with us. ",
        "OOOOOHHH YEAAAHH!",
        "Is this a really old version of Create? If so, update man. The trains look so much cooler then this",
        "Ah snappers.",
        "My favorite childhood YouTuber. Only Minecraft at age 22 I genuinely enjoy to watch. I\u2019ll never get sick of your videos Etho. I love the series!",
        "I like the idea that, since etho got the achievement, he hasn't ever actually made steak before",
        "Old man Etho had a ... restaurant. :))",
        "Hey Ladders,  Bdubs is into modded stuff lately im sure youve seen..  How awesome would it be if there was some collab action in the future",
        "Etho, you can put the super glue in your off hand and it will glue as you place blocks.",
        "I love this series. I wish you would do a long episode every so often, just to let us sit back and see how you play. Or maybe an unedited channel? upload your raw stuff?",
        "Wow, I really appreciate the extra time! I know it was probably mainly due to you really wanting to get to the turtle boat, but man, those extra minutes were fun! Thanks again for another great video, Etho!",
        "Hey Etho. Were you invited or interested in joining Tango, Keralis, Zedaph, Bdubs, and Scar on their Create server? The five of them make an awesome group but I can\u2019t help but think what a great addition you would be to that world. But then I remember that you have been real world busy lately and seem to mostly be doing solo play stuff. Figure that\u2019s because you don\u2019t have the time to make a commitment to a server or you don\u2019t want to get busy and be vacant from a server? Either way, I hope to see you join them in the future.",
        "I have never heard Etho panic like he did today lol, I literally re-winded it to make sure it actually happened. Love what your doing Etho",
        "Some tips with carts.\nThe chases blocks auto connect with similar facing ones of each other no glue required.\n\nEach super glue is a entity and can lead to lag, use slime on chassis instead. Right clicking their faces with slime acts like super glue. ",
        "Coooooking with ethoooo!!!",
        "you should check out what bdubs is doing with the create mod recently, pretty cool stuff",
        "I made my snacks in perfect time!",
        "Etho sounded happy and excited the whole video, that just gave me the positive energy i needed for today",
        "Great cooking advice as always, Etho \nRe tunnel bores, could TNT be deployed downward with a contraption like that? Not sure if you'll be needing a world eater for anything but it could be fun to see!\nThanks for the awesome episode!",
        "E sell seashells on the seashore",
        "Oh man hermit quest! What a callback! Great vid as always etho!",
        "I love love love this modded series thank you so much for doing it!!",
        "I normally watch Minecraft to relax and unwind but when Etho posts I get super excited!",
        "Would you need to use the slave thingy component for the mining machine to be able to sort the materials into the storage cabinets?",
        "Bring back fly boys when? ",
        "Hey Etho! Love your content! The issue you are having with the mobs might be solvable trough the configs of TeamAbnormals mods. I cannot for the life of me remember which one it is atm, but it has a config option (default set to true) to reduce friendly vanilla mobs in favor of theirs, but in my experience it blocks all vanilla animal spawns.  It could be Autumnity, but dont quote me on that.",
        "The goat",
        "Etho upload lets goo....i have been trying to interact with every upload since Etho and his family are still going through stuff <3",
        "When you use the Create super glue you don't need to use the chassis you can use any block as long as its all glued.",
        "Loving that star-wipe! Just like old times, heh.",
        "Etho, I put a frying pan on the hob but nobody came to tell me I was sizzling hot. What did I do wrong?",
        "A tip for the tunnel contraption.  Water, lava, creepers (and techically other mobs, but these machines usually are immune to mobs pushing them backwards)  will disrupt it and are the only things that can.  You will want to make a set of deployers to encapsulate the minecart in blocks (including the front) and a deployer to restock the minecart's fuel.  If you do those things, you can literally mine through lava lakes without any trouble.  I would also suggest adding a seat to keep the machine loaded and you can AFK on the machine with only the occasional need to check on it to empty the inventory.  If you add the seat, make sure the encapsulation protects you as well.",
        "I dont know why but an Etho Runescape playthrough would go hard",
        "furnance minecarts are very unreliable, from my many hours of testing, the most reliable is the version with powered rails and redstone torches  and drills in front of the deployers; with more deployers than drills (additional ring of deployers without drills in front of them)",
        "18:37 Etho went through the desert on a horse with no name. I don't know if I could come up with a more low-key reference than that.",
        "When Ethos videos come out, it really makes my day! Or should I say week\u2026. Or month",
        "mmmm air marinade! my favorite!",
        "Right?",
        "I'm so glad Ethos is finally discovering just how powerful the Create mod is. Can't wait to see him use it in future modpacks with the recent train update :)",
        "28:38, oh my, this might be hard to believe but just before this I was thinking like \"Man, I need to see Crash Landing again after this\" and then that comes up. Its a sign man!!! Also Crash Landing is what made me starting watching you so it has a special place in my heart!",
        "Someone just listening to this would be very confused ",
        "Etho constantly getting bugged by the Goblin trader while working gives me full on Taxes vibes it's great! Plus we get so many star wipes?? Today is a wonderful day.\nI gotta say...Etho's choice on mods is imppecable. The world is so pretty, and full of life and little sweet surprises. I feel so attached to this world now even though we are only 9 episodes in.",
        "W etho",
        "hahaha, Etho built a restaurant in ARK even :)",
        "It just me or does Etho sound like he's holding back laughter the whole video? Sounds like he was really having a great time playing!",
        "the good thing about being subbed to etho is that he has the determination to go back to a series like this until it's finished... maybe in 2028",
        "Having an entire unseasoned mostly raw steak that fell on the floor for breakfast, what a chad move.",
        "Finally the algorithm re-learned I want to see those videos as soon as they are uploaded.",
        "Love the video from Saskatchewan!",

        "Grill marks bud.",

        "Hey Etho! Have you ever played Cities Skylines or Sim City? They seem like open ended games you would enjoy. \n\nAlso, thank you for all the content you have produced over the years. I\u2019ve been watching you for about 10 years now and always watch every time you post!",
        "Etho, glad to see you're still wearing that amazing hat ;)",
        "Star wipe!! Miss the old floor break transitions for nostalgia lol",
        "Thank God we are back playing this",
        "Hey Etho. Been rewatching your ARK series, actually gotten me back into playing it again! Loved that series you did, it\u2019s like my fourth time watching it. Can\u2019t believe your ARK series is over seven years old. Will definitely watch Valhalla Pvp series after I\u2019m finished with this one. Will you return to the Arconauts server some day? Been watching you for over 10 years! From primary school to university! Still loving every single one of your videos! Thank you! You are my hero!",
        "Star wipe!!!",
        "Hey Etho\n\nIt would be cool if you build your own little workshop area just to make these trains. \nAnyways, thanks for still making videos after all these years.",
        "What is cooking with etho? \nHe only has one video on his channel with that. Is it an old episode?",

        "Magnificent machinery! Thanks for the good laughs too!",
        "Would you ever consider re-uploading/reviving an older series as an anniversary type of thing once it reaches a certain age?",
        "BWHAHAHAH this was great, you were so emotive at some points too pfft no worries, great episode, love it a ton!!",
        "really nice to see that you're still posting! even though its not often its very nice to know that there'll always be another video!",
        "Loving the modded series, as always :)\nWhat did you think of the new bamboo blocks coming in 1.20?",

Etho you have done a fabulous job at maintaining the quality of your videos.. You are the only youtuber for whom I watch all of the videos wherever they come in... I just finished watching your original chocolate island world. I think I found you when you first started the new world and even though I had seen parts of your old world I had not seen every episode, I just finished watching that... Somehow even though your videos are very simple in editing, just your pure raw genius ideas make the videos mind blowing and exciting.. Thank you for all the years of content you have given to us..",

On Sunday I was looking through his uploads to see if I had missed one and now here we are. Hypothesis confirmed. Data available upon request. Source: Trust me bro",

Do you have an overall favorite or maybe a specific favourite out of your modded LPs or multiplayer LPs etc how about a favourite non Minecraft LP? \n\nI personally have fond memories of your crash landing series but your original single player modded LP has to be the best you have done by far.",
        "Not sure if you know this already but just as a heads up. The super glue in this version of create can get really laggy (I think each piece is classed as an entity). They fixed it in the newer versions but that's for the newer MC versions.",

        "Etho is getting older, memory is getting weaker, luckily that means we can listen to him tell the same Canadian stories over and over. I hope he does the one with the bear and the maple bacon again",
        "Flyboys was so much fun!! It would be hilarious to see that again with Bdubs and the gang, and maybe more hermit craft members too!!",
        "Fantastic episode!",
        "Etho please give us your modpack",
        "You can kill the Goblin, it just takes multiple attemps",
        "If u use a wrench on the assembler you can lock rotation so it don\u2019t spin, also using a unloading belt can be faster at getting resources out :)",
        "cooking tip to figure out if your pan is hot enough: apply a THIN layer of grease (I use olive oil) to the pan before you place it over your heat source; when the pan gets hot, it will start to smoke; that's when your steak goes in the pan",
        "Are you planning on playing terraria anytime soon?",
        "haha, absolutely great intro!!! And I agree the 5 second rule, just shake it off and you are good to eat it!\n\nKeep improving your babytrain! It needs to place torches every five blocks! And make it to shoot mobs ",
        "Babe wake up! New Etho vid just dropped.",
        "\"That's an excellent question. Thank you for asking that. So -\" Etho is ready for his post-YouTube political career",
        "It would be so cool if turtle boats could dive. Then, these are a real improvement on the old fashioned boats",
        "today is a good day",
        "Love your vids Etho, thank you for what you do!",
        "Me and my friend have been doing 5 push ups times the amount of days etho hasn't uploaded. We got to 85 a day.",
        "still loving this series!",
        "Good episode see y'all in a couple of months!",
        "I kind of miss the expert pack series :(",
        "How's aboot you go ask Tango to join him, Pappa K, Scar, and Pink Shirt on Tango's Create server",
        "Etho when r u going to make a face reveal?",
        "\"Star Wipe!\"",
        "hey Etho! seems like the volume has been pretty low in recent videos in comparison to all other streams and Youtube I watch. Also I'm glad you weren't recording in between those clips because that was a comical coincidence when you turn and parts of your movable storage were gone XD.",
        "I watched this video when it came out, forgot to comment though, but I enjoyed it and enjoy watching the new modded series.",
        "Hey etho just a heads up, you've got enchanted mobs in this pack and I've found the ones with soul flames create a ton of lag (They leave flame trails behind them). When you get mobs (like bats) with this enchantment underground, they create a ton of flames in caves that burn other mobs and its ends up lagging a lot in areas you're around frequently. So u might wanna disable that part of the mod",
        "Now, as a chef, a big tip to remember is to never leave the handle of your pots, pans and skillets hanging out over the counter like that. Very easy to bump into it and spill food on the floor or yourself. Stay safe when cooking people :)",
        "commenting for the athogithm",
        "Oh yeah.\nEtho time=Blockbuster time!!!",
        "cooking with etho returns! don't worry, we never believed those dirty rumours.",
        "Etho, did you notice that when you use the slingshot, that the item it will use appears in the bottom left corner of the hotbar slingshot icon?",
        "The transitions for the cooking show was amazing. I rewatched it three times because it was so funny.",
        "What a strange little green thing. Must be hard working with Bdubs around",
        "Etho =D",
        "Cooking With Etho brings back so much nostalgia. I still remember when the joke about onions started.",
        "was not expecting to hear the name \"crash landing\" that series was so long ago wow"
