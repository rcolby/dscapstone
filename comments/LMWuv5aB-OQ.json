It was 3+ years in the making and we finally got the game. From the teasers and then the trailer a few weeks ago to now being able to play and see the game in action. This might go down as one of the best Bendy games that the team behind it has worked on. It's already so good.", "The fact that he manages to miss almost everything is honestly impressive and incredibly infuriating to watch", "It\u2019s so nice to be back in the studio. For some reason, it just kind of feels like home. I grew up, watching all these old, nostalgic, kind of cartoons with my grandfather, so the animation style of this game has always struck a chord with me. On top of that grandpa would\u2019ve loved watching this game if he was still alive. It would\u2019ve been something we watched and played together.", "WOW. And here I thought this game was abandoned. Seeing absolutely immense jump in quality, with the extra animations, smoother renderings, wider color palette, etc., just shows how much EFFORT has been put into this one. No wonder it has taken so long! Well worth the wait!", "So for those who didn't notice, the layout of the beginning, is almost identical to the layout of the first chapter in the first game, except instead of a hallway, it was replaced with an elevator in this one. That's why the layout looks so familiar.", "This game gives off major Bioshock vibes and I love it. So far it feels so much faster than the first installment!", "This man seriously uploaded part 2 an hour after the 1st part, unlike any other youtuber. That's just pure respect.", "You can see the hard work the devs put in this game. Props to them!", "Oh man! This game is looking absolutely fantastic so far! I can\u2019t wait to watch more and see what\u2019s become of the studio since the first game!", "man i found out and started watching bendy playthroughs as a highschooler, im a sophomore in college. bendy definitely helped me develop my art style and embrace that i like creepier media! excited to see where this game takes us", "Honestly Bendy has truly made it far after all of these years. After the many occurrences of Dark Revival being delayed or even cancelled it feels like a breath of fresh air to finally see the game released. I remember the day Bendy first came out and to this day I am still a very huge fan of the franchise. I remembered playing and enjoying the game back then and while yes their were a lot of issues that didn\u2019t stop me from playing and enjoying the gameplay and figuring out all of the lore. And seeing Dark Revival, it manages to kind of fix the problems that Ink Machine doe and managed to make it better. Overall seeing Dark Revival I am still legit excited to see how this game continues to go, also Cartoon Bendy is the most adorable thing I have ever seen fight me.", "The game looks so amazing, I'm very amazed by the work they've done and as always Fusion is one of the first people to post a vid on a new game, the vid was honestly overall amazing, good job Fusion and thank you for making the vid so quickly and I know they won't see this but good job to the creators of the game", "This far awesome ride. I love the little throwbacks they added and all the familiar tucked into the experience along side so much new, excited to see where the story goes :)", "I can not believe it has taken me this long to find you and your channel. Your play through is amazing, I love that you take the time to show the story and lore, and you played through the whole game in one day. Thank you honestly for the hard work, long game play, and posting at once instead of making us wait for each part. I have been anticipating this release for years and even though I can\u2019t get the game right now, Watching the play through is a good second. And it\u2019s not 18 min long that skips the story then asks us for the lore.", "This intro was such a masterclass on how to make good horror: I can hide and defend myself, but I'm still scared!\nAnd it looks so good! I'm both feeling nostalgic and in awe to see how much this evolved from BATIM", "Loving this game! I remember watching you play the first bendy game, but I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s been so long! Excited to see the endings!", "Can we just take a moment to appreciate that Fusion is always one of the first people to put out videos on new games", "I'm honestly excited to see how this game turns out to be.", "I never thought this day would come. It's so surreal. Also, let's appreciate how ontop of it Fusion is, always making great content for us within an hour of a new game coming out. Mad respect ", "BATDR is so well animated, props to the game developers for taking their time in creating an amazing game", "This man never misses a new game, its unreal-", "This new Bendy game gives me mixed vibes, it's like a combination of BioShock and We Happy Few, the atmosphere is very reminding of both games. I'm really excited to binge this let's play in a night!", "Can't believe it finally released despite the controversies. What a great game.", "Alice slowly opens a door labeled in bold \u201cCAUTION.\u201d Fusion-\u201cWhy is she being so cautious?\u201d", "Glad to see the game finally out! Can't wait to see you continue the series!", "Lots of people probably say this, but as one of the many long time viewers still watching this channel today, as well as new ones, this really is one of, if not the best horror gaming youtube channels to ever exist.\nHe really does his best to upload as consistently as he's able to, and he always makes his videos really fun to watch.", "This might go down as one of the best Bendy games that the team behind it has worked on. It's already so good.", "I absolutely love your play-throughs!! Each time I see a new video from you I grab the nearest snack and settle myself in for a fun ride! Thank you for making amazing content!! \ud83e\udee7", "this game is still incredibly unexpected and i am genuinely excited to see how this plays out", "Didn't expect it to release so early. So happy to see this series again.", "Can\u2019t wait to binge this right now!!! My most anticipated game ", "I love how quickly you put out content! But I hope this game has multiple pathways like the teaser suggested. If it does are you going to do a second playthrough doing the other pathways?", "I was so dissapointed in Kindlybeast when all of the allegations and employees came forward, I was really scared for the future of the game. I'm so happy to see it come back, I hope everyone involved in this game can feel proud of what they made and not be scared of being let go by the place they work on.", "The games graphics are insane, the game deserves the hype it gets, also the lore is revolutionary, it is not too confrontational but definitely leaves questions to be answered", "13:32 \nFusion: Oh, welcome home.\nHim saying that made that feel very eery. That felt like that was meant to be there.", "Really Appreciate the work put into pushing these vids out, Props to you!", "Aw we made Bendy cry!! That actually hurt to watch! Dang, what an amazing game! After so many years of waiting, we end up with this masterpiece! Thank you so much for playing Bendy and the Dark Revival, Fusion!", "This game is already looking great! I'm so happy this is back.", "I loved hearing the dialogue between Mimir and Kratos in this episode, it really showed us how troubled Mimir is because of his past deeds, and how wise Kratos has become. Also, it's so great to see Sean having a lot of fun with this game! Can't wait for more episodes!", "No matter what Fusion\u2019s videos will never disappoint even after years. Keep up the great work mate.", "Been so ready for this game! Excited to go through this adventure with you!", "Petition for mark to have his own podcast where he just reads stories. Literally anything. His voice is so soothing.", "It's so good to see bendy come back and how much the Batim team has improved. It's absolutely wonderful.", "LET\u2019S GO!! My day is already starting great when I see this! Can\u2019t wait to see what\u2019s in store!", "Combining the powerful forces of your channel, Super Horror Bros, and MatPat I can die happily!", "It's been three years, and it's well worth the wait!", "This is gonna be a lovely way to end a terrible day! Can\u2019t wait to watch the new entry into the world of Bendy! :D", "So glad this game is finally out! Loving the series so far Fusion!", "Its so great to see such a classic game return!", "This game is surprisingly realistic.

I really want to get this game!!!! Thank you so much Fusion for constantly uploading!", "I've been waiting for this game to come out for so unbelievably long.

And so far it looks amazing! Hopefully the whole game is as good as this!", "Ethan and Simon sniggering and laughing together like two naughty kids at the back of the class is my favourite part of this video.
