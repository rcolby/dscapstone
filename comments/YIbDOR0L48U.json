But I think it's 3racha as a whole man. Without Channie we wouldn't have SKZ so, he has to be in there. Changbin is just too badass not to be included in my bias and I think his personality is so goofy and laid back.

Especially Seungmin and Han. I love when they speak in English lol ", "Came from twitter to see this full moment myself 3:43  I feel like Seungmin was taken out of context here cause the second they laughed he realised he worded it wrong and tried to correct himself and when Changbin says I like it to fit he agreed and said yeah as in that\u2019s what he meant ( Changbin would rather show his muscles in more fitting clothes). You could see him panic and try to  correct himself. Literally was fidgeting with his hand and stuttering and saying no no no that\u2019s not what I said. I hope this is a learning moment for all of them because Changbin clearly looked uncomfortable as well as other members. (I know some people will disagree but this is how I saw this moment)", "It was so cute to see Seungmin compliment jeongin\u2019s fit and then putting one hand up so he wouldn\u2019t get lonely \ufe0f\ufe0f\ufe0f", "We can always count on Han to make the atmosphere a little bit awkward, love him", "It's cute how comfortable Lee Know looks even though it's an Englisch interview.", "This is the most lively i've seen all of them being in an English interview.

", "Han is really a genius n has a good leadership. He gave a witty, entertaining and articulate speech. Although English is not his native language,I love how he always tries to speak in English interview either in English or Korean language (because he knows there must be subtitles later). He always gives input during their interviews/contents so that we can learn more about them. Han was really so energetic and present throughout the interview. It makes the interviewer's job a lot easier.

Lee Know obviously doesn't feel very comfortable speaking English since his speaking isn't the best although he understands it well, and Chan still made a way for him to interact and Lee Know looked like he appreciated it.
