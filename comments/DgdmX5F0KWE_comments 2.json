        "Deji vs Mayweather is like a 5 year old playing against his dad and the dad lets him have a few shots ",
        "JJ has evolved he\u2019s mellowed out he isn\u2019t a ego maniac anymore",
        "You say deji wasn\u2019t even at his best yet gave Floyd a black eye as if it\u2019s credit when Floyd literally wasn\u2019t even trying at all. He made it look like a walk in the park which I expected already but I expected deji to at least give it everything he\u2019s got since he\u2019s only got this opportunity one time.",

        "Thank god that ksi\u2019s fans aren\u2019t being dillusional and agreeing with everything Ksi says because he\u2019s got an ego for him to think that him and his brother could beat floyd is a joke. Floyd was holding back and deji was scared of getting punished. The olatunji brothers needs a reality check.",
        "Nah deji worked hard he's now training with Daley there's no way deji could have won this fight but he did better than most YouTubers would have",
        "Jj , before I was watching u I had bad mental health but now U make  my day thank you",

        "3:35 I back you in everything you do but that\u2019s just pure waffle man. You\u2019ve fought a couple YouTubers and a bitchboy pro fighter that could barely stand up by himself, Mayweather is an unbeaten boxing hero. You don\u2019t come close. I\u2019m sorry but let\u2019s be realistic. The only reason Deji even got a hit on Floyd is because he allowed Deji to. Deji is one of my favorite people on the earth and he\u2019s one of my inspirations in life, but Mayweather could\u2019ve won in the first 20 seconds if he wanted to. Let\u2019s not get carried away here",

        "Ksi is delusional to think he can beat floyd, should have some self belief but man needs a reality check like he\u2019s legit fought no one",
        "Basically the ability JJ was giving is that JJ has gokus potential and Deji has Cohan\u2019s potential seen as hogan surpassed goku in the cell arc but then after that he slacked in his training similar to Deji so Deji has the potential but he doesent have the work ethic JJ has",
        "JJ is slowly getting more mature it\u2019s scary",

        "Ksi is barely on par with jake and Logan Paul how tf does he think he can take on mayweather",
        "Deji has no chance, The only reason he manged to bruse Mayweather is because Mayweather was playing around not being serous like he was asking Deji to hit him",
        "He bruised someone in a fight? Nothing at all surprising about that one mate ",
        "Ksi showing how delusional He can be sometimes he thinks he could beat floyd well he should actually fight him instead of saying Yh I could beat him\n\nNo hate to him but you can\u2019t win everything by just having the mindset of oh I can do it",
        "Such a humble guy for allowing the event to be about deji lol",
        "I'm sorry to say this but I hope Jake Paul humbles you next year.",
        "Bro Ksi, if your are seeing this comment (which you probably wont) cut the shit with deji and boxing. As a brother it is to have faith in your brother but its also good to be real with him as well. Under no scenario would deji have beat mayweather.",
        "I think Deji couldn't beat Mayweather. He jumped from Fousey to Mayweather. If he had done 5-10 fights make use of his technique and work on it as much as possible until he perfects it, workout and have the best physique he can possibly have (including cardio) and construct experience from fights. After that level up the fighters and after 20-30 fights in his career then fight Floyd with realistic chances of winning",
        "This is an L take on your brother.. Floyd made him wear smaller gloves the night before the fight and your brother took a softer approach because he didn\u2019t want to get knocked out which he would\u2019ve gotten knocked out if he threw like. Your brother could not have done more if your brother did more he would\u2019ve got knocked out and that\u2019s what your pushing your brother into",
        "Lost all respect I had in you trolled Messi  as if he was the problem",
        "Im p sure Floyd couldve beat Deji in a wheelchair with a blindfold on",
        "Everyone in the comment section not liking this one are they god damn yous chronically live online let the guy have an opinion lmao",
        "I could understand ksi getting mad at Deji for losing to wassabi, but him getting upset for losing to mayweather is just ridiculous.",

        "dejis lucky he didnt do what you think or he would be be in a coma",
        "Fight Tyron Woodley",

        "Come on JJ Deji was never winning that fight he\u2019s a veteran the best arguably ever rate deji for the bag",

        "Bro Deji did good I know he lost in the end but he fought well and honestly we should all be proud of him",
        "Honestly I only watched the highlights\u2026. But for the like 7 minutes I saw maybe 2 decent combos\u2026 Deji barely through punches like he\u2019ll throw some power shots or Atleast try some combos in the early rounds",
        "Deji did say he knew he wouldnt win but he woud give it his all",
        "I know it\u2019s great to be confident in yourself. I\u2019m not like that very much but I understand the mindset of telling yourself you\u2019re better than everyone. But there comes a time where reality needs to be checked lol JJ, Deji did well in giving Mayweather a bruise to the eye & realistically that\u2019s all he needed to do. He landed a good shot on one of the greatest. Yes he\u2019s your brother, you & only you know him the best. But Deji went from Fousey to Mayweather, that is an unrealistic & unreasonable jump for someone who JUST gained some confidence barely 3 months ago. He\u2019s an amateur & he needs years worth of training to be able to actually beat someone like that. Just because he gave him a bruise doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s a knockout potential. Floyd\u2019s been hit way harder & it\u2019ll take a lot more than what you or Deji have combined. ",
        "JJ is simply wrong about Deji vs Floyd and his general take about beating Floyd. The jab is what Floyd used to stop him every time. JJ likely would get knocked out simple bc a counter punch is what Floyd need to end it.",
        "Honestly I feel like deji did way better than Logan. Floyd really worked him and was showboating to get in dejis head. The fact that he put in work against someone like Mayweather is just insane",
        "Deji beating floyd in boxing is like KSI beating Einstein in Physics.",

        "We need Ethan & Jj try not to laugh challenge series with forfeit of who ever smile or laugh..MO make it happen! ",
        "bro tbh floyd just played deji",
        "I respect his general mindset when it comes to overcoming hurdles in life, but come on. Now it just sounds bare disrespectful to the guys, who dedicated their whole life to the sport, went in there with Floyd, arguably the best to ever do it, and didn\u00b4t manage to beat him. It just is not realistic to get in the ring and beat Floyd, when you learnt how to throw a jab 6 years ago and fought a bunch of journeymen. Floyd would absolutely annihilate anyone on the ytb boxing scene with one arm behind his back and his legs taped together.",
        "I was gonna watch this till he kept going on about his spastic brother now I dint even wanna watch him get bashed his not goku ever",
        "Ksi saying he believes he could beat mayweather is one of the most delusional things I've ever heard.",
        "The people that are saying that the new videos that are high production are bad, are just living of nostalgia. I love the old videos that they made, but as JJ said, they can\u00b4t just make the same low quality videos.",
        "Deji did what he did at the end of the day he fought 1 of the best boxers in the world & that itself is a accomplishment but like I said Floyd is allot better than most ppl even at his age",
        "Let's just  appreciate how much work he puts in these videos to make our day huge respect! ",
        "JJ wtf are you talking about lmao you're not knocking out Floyd nor is Deji",
        "Can we be honest here for a second? Deji couldn\u2019t have beaten Floyd because Floyd is simply just levels about him. I respect the mindset ksi has but it\u2019s just not realistic when it comes to boxing. Also of course Floyd got a black eye, he had his guard down the whole fight. FairPlay to deji for getting in the ring with him but I think the result would\u2019ve been the same if he worked twice as hard. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.",
        "JJ should just go back to rapping",
        "When deji loses ksi is always making excuses for him saying he didn\u2019t give it 100% . Deji no matter how much training has no shot against mayweather",

        "JJ it's not always how it looks on the TV. You look at Deji vs Floyd and are like \"why tf isn't deji hitting him\" but you don't understand how tough it is the pressure that radiates from an amazing boxer like mayweather",

        "The reason jj feels deji could of done better is the fact floyd was not trying i thought jj would understand this is 5 percent floyd.",
        "The green on the right suggests that JJ is money minded, like floyd mayweather, has success within his grasps but also engrossed in his babatunde tribe, hunting down cheetahs. ",

        "Is that why he doesn\u2019t have windows activated?",
        "I don't agree with the 'one camera man over the studio crew' comment. It's hard for them to record and make content at the same time. You want to see everyone fully and them being comfortable not holding anything instead of them have to focus on the scene at the same time do the camera works. Remember the time Harry jumped on a car and fell, only Vikkstar had his camera on an angle and almost didn't capture that legendary moment. Even that footage was half-ed, we really didn't see Harry jumped on top of the car, we just saw him fell.",
        "alright i love you jj but neither deji or you have a chance against mayweather. This is the reason you get hated because your ego is insane. Think brother think he's the champion for a reason.",

        "my favourite videos have to be the ones in public but its hard for them to do it, a-z is my probably my favourite and the bingos etc were so nice, it was so good to switch things up doing that a-z last sidemen sunday",
        "If you take JJs determination and Dejis natural athleticism. You\u2019ve got a damn good fighter.  Even JJ knows Deji could be better than him",
        "Deji is more like Gohan ngl, he has this crazy hidden potential but does nothing with it. same with gohan he was forced to study in his earlier years and now he's getting back into it (beast form) deji will get there hopefully!!!",

        "There will never be enough appreciated for the actions that KSI has taken. Such a good guy.",
        "I love you JJ but you wouldn\u2019t stand a chance against a fully determined to win Mayweather. You may be the complete opposite weight class, you may tower over him in height and you may have longer reach but this man has gone 50+ fights without a single loss. you cannot just step into the ring beat a man that is that good at what he does best just because you\u2019re bigger than him. that\u2019s not how that works.",
        "I don\u2019t want to be that guy but JJ, I live in Texas and that b roll footage you showed before the poster ad for the fight was a view of Dallas, not Austin.",

If anything, obviously Deji wasn't on the same level as Floyd, his fighting style wasn't also the best either. Floyd on the other hand had his hands down the whole fight so it was kinda expected he'd get shot by some punches or so. Not to mention Floyd is legit a master of defense and patience, realistically, if Deji was on the same level of a pro-boxer, he might've been able to put up a much better fight instead of being hesitant, but that still wouldn't be good enough considering how Floyd fights, weeving, ducking and rolling the shoulder while punching enough to score the points, which is the cement of his fighting style, and looking his fights versus Canelo and even Pacquiao (despite me being a Filipino and a Pacquiao fan), they couldn't touch him enough because of his defense and patience (the latter I think is what makes Floyd an amazing boxer).",

I agree that he was a little too cautious and didnt throw that many punches, but you cant say he didnt train that well because he not only had to switch to 10oz gloves but he also had to wait a whole hour to enter the ring.  And also Mayweather not taking the fight seriously and dancing around deji like he won before they even started fighting, probably made deji feel like he wasnt good enough. And everyone saying Ksi and Deji are delusional for thinking they can beat mayweather, theyre not... Floyd is washed up and old, maybe back in his prime it would be acceptable but now? One clean shot and hes done for, you saw how easily deji bruised him, everyone just scared of him and think hes a goat cause he never lost.

However, I have to say it but I hate what YouTubers and TilTokers have done to Boxing as a sport. Not saying g you\u2019re not talented but will say you have made it more quicker in the sport due to your fame levels. Loads of boxers I know that train 5/6 times a week have still not been recognised. Your not you are their level. You can set these fights up with pros because of your chosen careers only. I feel sorry for the regular people who have trained like animals for most of their lives that have not got the chance yet. So when you say Deji or you can beat Floyd, I would say some of my friends would flatten you both but still lose to Floyd. He is the greatest today. Respect again to you for your business and content but sorry not for the sport. Stay well ",

Floyd was taking the absolute piss out of deji he can finish these amateurs in seconds if he really wanted to but he makes a show out of it to give people there moneys worth.",
        "You have to respect Deji anyways for the work he put in... obviously Floyd Mayweather has way more experience than Deji in Boxing. However than doesn't determine who can or will win the fight. In other words, the posibility of deji winning was there but it was really low, anyways, you have to respect the fact that he took the fight.",

I understand y\u2019all are being real and not riding JJ but in my opinion, you just gotta try innit if there is a possibility and ya have the mindset to win",
        "Its not bad to be confident but you should know when its enough. Floyd would've smoked deji in 2 rounds if he were serious and same would happen to jj",

        "Sometimes JJ can be the biggest casual on the planet. How tf are u expecting deji to do bits against mayweather, someone who\u2019s boxed all his life, and retired undefeated against PROS. By all means, root for ur brother but u can\u2019t actually have believed that deji was gonna hurt him even if he \u201cwent 110%\u201d. The reason deji was so timid was because Floyd made him confused from the get go. He\u2019s just too experienced. Floyd would do the exact same to JJ as well.",

        "Regardless of the boxing stuff, that's a pretty good mindset to have.  You are what you grow into.  Just gotta know what growth actually means.",
        "Nah, you've gotta have more of a realist mindset. Deji \"survived\" 6 rounds getting absolutely lit up by the greatest boxer to ever enter the ring, and probably got the biggest bag of his career from it, too. Deji might have lost on paper but he's won in what matters in the long-term. I feel like this fight, win or lose, was exactly what Deji needed to become an even better boxer going forward.",

Also, I appreciate that you had all of your focus on Deji instead of entertaining Jake and Tyron\u2019s childish games. Big ups to the Olatunji bros for life!",

        "I like the idea of being in the mind set of being able to beat floyd but realistically it won\u2019t happen Floyd was messing around the whole time and I\u2019m sure deji noticed it so he didn\u2019t wanna go too far since any second Floyd coulda flipped a switch and destroyed deji easily",

Deji is not 50-0 good. no one expected him to win, its delusional for you to think he could. People didn't buy the tickets to see Deji win, they watched it for entertainment which was delivered.",

But everyone who is placing him on an unbeatable pedestal is delusional, we are all human and the fact that Deji gave him a black eye is more than enough proof. Deji doesn't work as hard as he could, no way near but he's improving and it's admirable, I personally don't think he is quite cut out yet to take on fights especially athletes like Mayweather. Ksi definitely has a better shot than any other youtuber, let him be confident there is no need to drag him down so keep a strong mindset and encourage yourself even when your most loyal fans don't.",
