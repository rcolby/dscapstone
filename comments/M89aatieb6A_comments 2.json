        "You're right Ryan, a snow plow can't move 6ft of snow very fast.... That's why our plow drivers & DPW crews end up with 90-100 hrs a week in this. They'll start plowing when there's 3 inches & only sleep 4 hrs a day till the storm stops",

        "Most of the northern tier states have very good snow removal plans. They wouldn't wait until the storm was over to remove the snow, they would be going around the clock in shifts to keep the main roads open. The real danger comes from having that amount of snow (6' if the forecast is accurate) on top of buildings and homes. That's quite a bit of weight, more weight than can structurally be supported, and there are going to be buildings destroyed by this. North and South Dakota had a major blizzard in the 1990's, that caused 10' snow drifts across the roads. Traffic moving through these areas had a literal wall of ice and snow on either side of the road, that stretched for miles.",

You had snow shovels ready.  You had clothes for such things.  The snow removal crew (plows, big tractors, dump trucks, etc.) are some of the best in the nation (I wish all southwest OH snowplow drivers had to go train there in Western NY.)  The high school in our little town there regularly had kids riding snow mobiles to school.  It rarely closed, either.  This storm would suffice to close schools, though!  lol",

I define a bunker zone as the warmest room in your house away from windows and doors that you can stay in just in case the power and heat goes off.  You can use blankets to make a room if you need.  Warm teas and hotcoco go along way, but make sure you have food that doesn't need cooked as well as your power outages could make it impossible to cook.
