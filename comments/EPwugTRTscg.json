Breeding (or whatever you are doing) is so hard for this exact reason. Nothing is ever promised and things can and do go wrong. If you are really serious about breeding (or whatever) and being responsible and ethical then PLEASE, get all the pups and mama OFA tested and make sure futured studs are as well and everything checks out good. I have watched and loved you guys for so long but id never be able to support anyone backyard breeding, especially those who have such reach. Doing OFA is so important as it can tell you how healthy your dog is health and body condition wise. PLEASE look at the OFA recommendations for Goldens and OFA these pups and any you may have in the future. Holding people responsible for having responisble breeding practices and breeding only healthy dogs is how we are going to end the overcrowding and overflow of shelters.", "That last scene of Joey holding the puppy up, he\u2019s got blood on his face  thinking of you both and Monty and all the babies!
