        "actually the mosquito drone does come in a couple times, like when it lands on the FBI car.  I do agree that Ross is the worst CIA agent ever.  I saw nothing wrong with the scenes with the mercenaries- it would be like another country sending mercenaries into a U.S. nuclear missile silo.  Shuri's decision to spare Namor didn't make a huge amount of sense, but I knew they couldn't kill the character.  I do think Riri was done a lot better than America.  I disagree with the assessment of Shuri- Letitia really stepped up to the plate.",

        "It wasn't that bad. I turned my brain off expected nothing, but the characters felt way better compared to the last jedi for example. The story itself is meeh. Not one I will remember in a few years.",

Disney of all studios should know how to make CGI work and look good , that alone lets us know this movie is just about getting \"phase 4\" going and swapping to mostly all female Avengers , storyline and everything else is an afterthought",

        "95% verified audiance score on RT, A on Cinemascore, 93% positive with 85% definite recommendation on PostTrack poll. Nearly 550m worldwide after 2nd weekend. Unanimous praise for Namor and Tenoch Huerta. But who cares what critics or audiance feels. But Drinker sys it's bad, so it's bad. If he says it's equivalent to WW84, then that must be the truth! What's ok then? Black Adam is totally \"OK\"! A film, that is struggling to cross 400m lifetime and is almost 150-200m behind the break even number. But that's an okay film but Wakanda Forever is baaaaad ",

        "While I don\u2019t necessarily agree with everything in this review, there are a number of valid critiques here.\n\nI respect Marvel for at least handling Chadwick\u2019s passing tastefully, but man there were hurdles that needed to be climbed.",
        "The only thing i didn\u2019t like was Riri Williams. Other than that i thought the movie was pretty decent",
        "Hi Drinker, this comment has absolutely nothing to do with Wakanda Forever or your review.  And I'm sorry about that.  But could you do a review of 'Shawn of the Dead'?",
        "Haven't seen the movie (and it sounds mediocre so I probably won't) but I think Ocean Guy looks pretty cool.",
        "Riri is the most ghettofied Wakandan name and you can't take anyone named that seriously",
        "I am very confused on how exactly this movie is so bad to people? Like i thought it was great, i dont see any major issues whatsoever",
        "Apart from the very clear issues with the movie, such as the pacing, the expressions and emotional impact of characters, and a rushed feeling of shuri coming to closure; it was a good movie. It told an interesting story that yes, was drawn out a little too much and could\u2019ve had a bit more action sequences, but still had me invested for a majority of the film. Every time Namor or Talokan was on screen it was perfect. Honestly, this video could\u2019ve been 5 min. The issues you present come across as very ignorant as if you haven\u2019t watched any of the past Mcu movies or even this one. You literally went on for 5 minutes abt how Wakanda prolly isn\u2019t the most powerful country in the world. What?? Please tell me what tf a dude with a gun is going to a mf who\u2019s wearing BULLET PROOF armor. Like\u2026? Idk it was a fun video but it seems like you\u2019re nitpicking for scraps.",

        "5:00 Actually, the most powerful nation in the world is very clearly Norway. This is because New Asgard is located in Norway, and Thor could solo literally all of Wakanda by himself.",
        "I'm rewatching all his videos now that he has passed and that ending just really hits different. \"I'm free.\" The Great Potato War is what I believe is the ultimate display of Techno's true capacity in scary intelligence and shocking talent. His remarkable characteristics have made him so unique and embroidered in most everything minecraft by now. Mad respect. RIP",

        "Angela Bassett started working out 2 play Tina Turner n Whats Love Got To Do With It & she stuck with it",
        "Riri Williams was originally Starks prodigy like Spider-Man. However, since MCU Stark died in infinite war it kinda ruins her story. She caught his eye when she was able to somewhat reverse engineer his suit. She was also much younger then her movie counterpart and was fifth-teen attending MIT to be an astronaut.",
        "You know, I used to think that Shuri becoming Black Panther would be cool to see simply because she\u2019s so not suited for the role so she\u2019d need a huge character arch. The trouble is, the writers aren\u2019t good enough to pull it off.",
        "Can you do a review of woman king",
        "Thanks again for watching movies so I don\u2019t have to!",
        "I also can't get over the fact that they ruined Namor as a character, his backstory was completely changed to fit \"The message\", his ankle wings are a product of its time, he is one of the very first characters Marvel did along with Cap and the original Human Torch, but my God, he is so pathetic here while in the comics he is more of an unpredictable and scary wild card switching sides to his convenience.",
        "I recommend watching Black Adam instead",
        "Tchalla dies then There should have been a war for the black panther mantel then some cool dude in the movie he's Tchalla and killmonger in one guy he takes one of the black suits to save the royal family from a sneak attack nearly killing about a lot of ppl  then he asked to return the suit but refuses. He still does good shit. Then final fight against namor and wakanda cheering for the black panther who is not royalty but who is like the spirit of the panther. Not a king  but a protector. Sheeri and mom queen can have the throne but the new black panther is more black and even more cool headed. And he ain't no uncle Tom Michael jai white tbh. Just a broke talented brother tryin to do the right thing.",
        "Why we need another girl superhero? what that will proof, world don't have strong man any more or don't need them . If I will save by the woman I will be in shame to rest of my life if she kicks my ass that's will be good reason to end my life. Why they putting that girl's in that role girl's don't need them and boy's don't need them there .",
        "The pacing makes an Arctic glacier look like an f1 car......lmao!",
        "Wokebrokanda forever",
        "Just make Winston Duke (M'baku) the new Panther Man. He's extremely likable. He could grow from the guy who lost the fight to the original Panther Person, because he was too angry or didn't have the right mind set. He could be the new Panther Guy after some personal growth.",
        "The only movie critic I trust !",
        "Namor is one of Marvel's first characters and they did him little to no justice.",
        "I would\u2019ve liked it if it was more like the comics when shuri took the throne. Namor and shuri/tchalla had a back and forth till they both lost a lot. Then the beef was kind of squashed after secret wars.",
        "Wakandan Jarvis ",
        "8:10 Wasn't the mosquito drone seen again during the attack on Riri's warehouse? It was a tracking shot of the mosquito, it sticks to the armored truck to hack it or something. Forgot what happened exactly after that",
        "even though this movie is dead average, but it still way say better than black adam.",
        "I deadass felt like I was watching a bollywood movie",
        "Thank you for the recap. I sat through this cinema mess and couldn\u2019t follow the plot for anything. This movie has the weakest antagonist ever and I couldn\u2019t figure out which person was the real protagonist. CGI salad and then pacing suffers death by dialogue. Too much needless talking scenes. Do yourself a favor and wait for streaming so you can at least hit FF.",
        "The movie was not bad vangela Bassett deserves a Oscar for her preformance...seems like you are getting paid to bash the movie bro calm down the movie is based off a comic book",
        "Ya it was even worse than what I feared. It kills me how these critics say it's a masterpiece.\n\nIf taking a crap on film is a masterpiece then I guess it is.",
        "Wish the Avengers were there to see T'Challa in his final moments.",
        "It would have been way more impactful to have Namor kill T\u2019Challa in the opening scene to establish how much of a threat Namor is, kind of like a Thanos in Infinity War type-thing. Maybe some Star Wars-esque crawl in the opening credits to explain their rivalry and how they got into this situation. All they had to do was CGI the Black Panther suit and establish that T\u2019Challa is in it, have a big overblown CGI fight, and have Namor pull T\u2019Challa down to the deep ocean floor. Fade to black for a moment then Namor respectfully returns his body to establish him as a man of honor to add some intrigue to the character. Then a respectful funeral scene. Have the leaders of the Wakandan tribes duke it out for the Black Panther mantle, maybe add some political discourse and exposition on Namor, and bam get on with the story with a new Black Panther. In the first act the protagonist is shown as dangerous yet principled, Chadwick Boseman\u2019s character gets an honorable send off, and we have a new Black Panther.",
        "I see a lot of nitpicking",
        "Worst introduction of an amazing character(Namor) and making up characters like Suri and RiRi just to pander to the woke and female crowd is just ridiculous.",
        "The thing that got me about the whole riri Williams thing is the Wakanda's assumed she was a old white women and were thinking about turning her in to Neymar but when they found out she was a black women it changed to protect her at all cost even if it leads to war..... Come on",
        "The movie was trash  bro I was disappointed \ufe0f",
        "Commentator \nis jealous",
        "It's funny how the Winter Soldier was cryogenically frozen while Shuri figured out how to deprogram him and T'challa died, wasting away to his death. Gotta love those Marvel plot holes.",
        "Bassett is not that good as an actress.",
        "I didnt like black pamper because shitty diapers stink!",
        "Wakanda Forever has a 95% on rotten tomatoes.\nI think the only explanation is the starting and ending scenes were enough to cause people to forget the middle apparently. \nThoughts?",
        "It just looks like an excuse for woman love and a further excuse to redo Namor as some kind of Nancy boy. The only slightly strong male was Ross and he was made to look crap.",
        "Namor casually giving Shuri a water suit of someone he probably killed painfully and removed their body from was pretty morbidly funny",
        "Disney respects African culture with wakanda forevever but makes a laughing stock of Norse culture in love and thunder. You can see where their agenda lies",
        "\u201cI guess if you get really Ill you must have to take more of it to reinforce it or something\u201d \u2026nice",
        "You are a uniquely brilliant critic!",
        "It says something about the state of the MCU when I look forward to the drinker's review of the movie more than I look forward to the movie itself",
        "Wasn't perfect, super hero movies never are but I feel that this time, a lot of things flew over Drinkers head. Could do with a sober rewatch Drinker.",
        "As someone who's worked in the filmmaking industry for too many years, in VFX/Post, it's always amazing to me that anything cohesive from Marvel even makes it to final edit.  All of these big budget high profile FX heavy movies are written by one committee, designed by a 2nd committee, produced by a 3rd committee, directed by a 4th committee, edited by a 5th committee, then distributed/marketed by yet another committee.  Each of whom have their own separate agendas and ideas, and barely communicate with each other.  Not to mention the multiple teams of lawyers, 200 layers of approval on every little thing, then some clueless studio head randomly coming in at the last minute to play \"Director\" and demand changes!",
        "Only thing good about the movie was the post credit scene",
        "I love that my watch List is based on your reviews!  You have my style of humor and I'm glad you have a platform here to entertain us ",
        "Movie was suppose to have Doctor Doom in it. What happened? Too scared to change and be better. Disney made Black Panther a super scam to hurt the guy who could not save himself, and now the sequel without him is destroying him more in spirit. Hollywood has been in the wrong the whole time and we get this trash when Japan and China have better more fun movies.",
        "Wrong. Wakanda forever has the best story telling of all time.",
        "One of the biggest gripe I had with the movie is why the heck wasn't Bucky present for Tchalla's funeral? Bucky owes him his life",
        "What Chadwick Bozeman\u2019s family said was heal up d rather people recast him",
        "This entire video seems like you\u2019re just bashing something that is successful just cause you don\u2019t like superhero movies and marvel in general. The movie wasn\u2019t perfect obviously but it is not the garbage you make it out to be, this video REEKS of you not knowing anything about marvel and their characters",
        "The real wakanda was inside us all along",
        "If you want a solid Black Panther story and a more thoughtfully fleshed out Wakanda, just watch the 2008 animation.",
        "gotta disagree",
        "oceanman, take me by the hand, lead me to the land that you understand",
        "Listen mate, I wanted to defend the movie. But your completely accurate . I found myself laughing with you, Black Panther made me proud to be black. This is shii'",
        "I'd like to see a CoD review from you... nothing is real enough. ",
        "From the way you describe this movie, it sounds like a movie from THE ASYLUM film studio :)",
        "\"It's OK when we do it\" is just a manifestation of the underlying theme of all superhero stories: Might is Right.",
        "After seeing Riri Williams pop up in this movie, I think we all know they're litterally making an all female Avengers cast. They have She-Hulk, whomever that chick was from the Hawkeye tv show, and now Riri. And Twitter got their knickers in a twist when fed up people called out the M-She-U for what they're doing.",
        "YAYYYY!!   WOKE-ANDA FOREVER!!... SUCH A... cough cough.. er... 'Well written, scripted, well acted, well made and well received movie'... Ahem...     \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7",
        "I have a feeling that your summary is more entertaining than the actual movie.",
        "At one point, because of how powerful Angela Basset was in this film, I genuinely thought she was going to be black panther.. but no. It was LONG but I liked it more than the first one",
        "I knew it was going to be bad, for so many reasons it couldn't be anything else. Maybe if it gets remade in the future, it'll be a good movie.",
        "the best part - Angela Bassett as the Black Cougar ",
        "MCU still in that \"Let's make all of our Main characters Female\" state of mind too then it seems?",

        "Alternative title: Drinker explains how the US will spread \"democracy\" to the ocean",
        "I saw this last night.  It might be the worst movie I have ever seen.",
        "Dude, the \"most powerful nation\" stuff made no sense.  And also, what about the fish people falling asleep on land and waking up not being able to breathe on land?  Shouldn't that knot have just tied itself right away?  Or wouldn't at least have of them thought to do something other than run into the water?  Super easy to fix that issue by having them fall-out on a low-tide beach and wake up underwater after the tide comes in",
        "I think there were plenty of ups and downs. In my opinion I really loved the movie, but that is just me. Sad that Chadwick Boseman died",
        "I\u2019ll support any movie with a black cast but when the movie sucks as bad as this one did, I can\u2019t do it.",
        "you cant be good at fighting if you are a nerd\nsimple as",
        "People talk about it being ok or mediocre, but you should've seen the live stream review, Drinker explained the exact plot simplified and it sounded like a 10 year old wrote it  ",
        "My big issue with the modern crop of woke characters is that the writers seem compelled to always present them as competent and flawless paragons of virtue instantly loved and accepted by thier peers and legacy characters. Queen Romunda should've been absolutely grief stricken even to the point of descending into madness at the loss of her son. Instead of instantly accepting Shuri as the Black Panther, M'Baku should've challenged her and lost, so Shuri earns his respect instead instantly giving it on sight of a 90lb who he already knows wasn't raised as a warrior. Same thing with the SW sequels. Having to survive on a desolate planet by herself, Rey should've been more of a scrappy and untrustworthy thief that eventually becomes a good person. The presentation is the issue.",
        "Namor's people actually started out green skinned in the comics & later on blue skinned when he was rediscovered by the Fantastic Four. These stories pre-date James Cameron's Avatar by 3 decades.",
        "I didn't think the first one was a masterpiece.\nBut it wasn't bad. Black Panther as a character was fine, I think it could have been better, but he wasn't bad, and was acted very well indeed.\nThe antagonist was interesting to me, because he wasn't really wrong with quite a few of his points. He was a villain, because he went to far with his ideas for sure, but there were some true points for sure. That made him interesting to me.",
        "Since there are so many teenage prodigies now, wouldn't that make them the new norm, and everyone else is now stupid?",
        "There should have just been a power struggle in Wakanda now that T\u2019challa had died. You know, all the tribes want to fight for the throne and causes infighting - like civil war but worse.",
        "Im gonna have to disagree. Grief was present throughout the whole movie & it was handled super well. to say Namor is the worst villain &  doesn\u2019t have any motive is such a white take. You clearly missed the whole idea behind Namor being a man scorned because he witnessed Spanish colonization & how vile it was. It\u2019s pretty simple: he was motivated to protect his people from being exploited by white people yet again, & he would do anything possible to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen. This is his grief. Instead of nitpicking random things like how shuri got Ross\u2019 attention, maybe take a second to see the nuance of colonization from a pretty emotional & different perspective than we\u2019ve seen in the MCU. & if you truly can\u2019t see his motivation STILL, it\u2019s possible this movie just wasn\u2019t for a white like you. & btw, saying Namor looks ridiculous when it\u2019s pretty obvious Talokan/Namor were heavily influenced by historically accurate depictions of traditional mesoamerican art & culture feels a little racist",
        "I think it's fine that Wakanda doesn't want any business with the rest of the world's problems. It's not your problem",

        "I really think you should start by stating whats good about a movie, not because i care but because you really start to spiral into seeing veerything in a bad light. You say f.e. that \"Namor isnt intimidating\" , he threatens Wakanda during the \"Info dump\" and then proceeds to follow it up by literally invading them, killing tons of Civillians and their queen just to demonstrate his advantage. I agree with a lot of things you say about this movie but you really choose to ignore so many great aspects about it its frustrating imo. (Examples: The scene where M'Baku shows up for the trial is an insanely detailed character choice for shuri and surprised me in every way / The time this movie takes for world building is a big improvement, Namor and his city are well explained and their existence makes perfect sense within the universe as well as the reason they are only coming up now)          ",

I haven't watched Dr Strange MOM or Thor4 yet but if this movie is any indication then Marvel really has run out of ideas at this point. I found no \"Marvel Magic\" at all in this movie, so much of the plot makes 0 sense, people do things for no good reason.",

The comic failed and they should\u2019ve made adjustments to compensate but there were a lot of cool moments in the movie. And there were legal issues with Namor so they had to change his ethnicity to mayan and I don\u2019t understand the big issue with that. They change the origin stories for plenty of marvel characters and nobody cared. Idk, i get the movie wasn\u2019t the greatest, or as good as the first Black Panther. But the outrage its getting and people dealing with extremes like,\u201dAm i racist if I dislike it?\u201d As a black man no, you are entitled to your own opinions, and if anyone calls you racist they\u2019re stupid or they\u2019re trolling.

And sure, Riri could have been more fleshed out, but I still think that this was still a good tribute to Boseman. It wasn\u2019t like they just slapped it in the beginning to reel viewers in and then just rushed out a sloppily made film, albeit with a little unfocused perspective like how the Drinker proclaims. Even if you think that, I would give this movie a pass since they were dealing with the death of the actor of the main character, so it\u2019s good for what they had in their disposal. Even EVEN so, everything I mentioned were either little contrivances or plot holes, at least how I saw it. It didn\u2019t take away from the main theme of loss and how different people deal with it. If you think otherwise, that is a-ok. But, this, in barely any way, did it tarnish the name of Chadwick Boseman and the Black Panther.",

This could be done while the political conflict unfolds as an alliance of African nations, embittered by Wakanda\u2019s broken promises and emboldened by the sense that with the King\u2019s death that Wakanda may be weak enough to invade / strong arm?

        "I was absolutely disgusted by this movie and all its aspects, and chief among them was the vile moral decisions that are played off like no big deal.  Queen Ramonda takes a massive shit all over everything her son did during his rule and gets mad when anybody questions her decisions, which appear to be made purely based on emotion rather than what's actually best for her country.  Shuri is a selfish, narcissistic psychopath who publicly spits directly in the face of all of both Wakanda's and her family's most sacred traditions whenever she can.  She usurps the mantle of the Black Panther, Wakanda's noble ancestral protector, without having ever done anything to demonstrate a worthiness or qualification for the position, and as previously stated, disgraces the rituals involved in taking up the role.  Then, once she was finished naming herself Black Panther, she dons the armor of Killmonger, another usurper with no respect for the traditions of his homeland, and proceeds to bully her advisors into pledging their warriors to her crusade for revenge, unilaterally deciding to take her country to war for her own personal reasons, a decision which saw dozens killed needlessly and for which she received no consequences or reprimand.",

        "I didn't see the ocean man as a villan,  because his motives are more resaonable than the wankandans. Save one person from death by sacrificing hundres of lives... Really? That remindme of Tywin Lannister when he said: \"Tell me how is more honorable killing thousands in battle than killing a few in dinner?\"",
        "I wish it would be good but it's crap",
        "The only movie to make me fall asleep in theaters",
        "His point on \u2018Its ok when we do it\u2019 is actually straight facts. They went completely against what they said towards the end of the first film.",
        "Imagine if you took the purple  juice & the super soldier serum & your suit and claws are made from a mix of vibranium and adamantium & you give it to someone like spiderman, dr strange, black widow or antman, even iron man if he wasn't dead to wear under an iron suit MK65  falcon would actually be worthy of the captain america mantle, peter quill",
        "By the third hour of the movie, I constantly kept looking at my phone to check the time. Even with flashy action scenes and emotional ones, I just wanted out. At the point where Namor attacks Wakanda, I thought that was it: the classic big final fight. But no, it just kept going and going. It could've been a 2 hour movie easily if they had rewritten the script.",
        "Yeah that whole idea of Namor needing Wakanda to help him track down and kill a scientist made zero sense to me. I really didn't understand his whole motivation in this movie. And I agree that the pacing is horrendous in this movie. Ross didn't even need to be in this movie at all, he had no real purpose. Riri barely had a purpose. They clearly had no idea what to do with this movie and should have just done nothing smh",
        "Mess is a understatement",
        "Dear critical drinker, I think you're really mourning the downfall of marvel and can't just believe another movie can be good. I thought Wakanda forever was very enjoyable. The script was already done but when Chadwick died, they had to improvise.\nThe action sequences were 9 of 10 and it was almost prefect. Although the pacing was obviously quite an issue but come on it was a mourning movie didn't you feel anything?",
        "I went with my father and my two brothers to watch this (we went to the cinema since iron man watching the MCU). My father slept through more than half of the film",
        "Has anyone else noticed that whenever a new female character is shoehorned into a story, the writers put a lampshade over it by having another established character say \"I like her.\" They use this exact same ploy every. Single. Time.",
        "The bias is prosperous.",
        "Very bad movie even my kids did not like it",
        "Despite being someone who really liked Riri in this film, I do agree with your point that her role in this film is primarily setup for future MCU projects.\n\nLike you could tell me that Shuri developed the vibranium detector for Wakanda, in the original script, and I would\u2019ve totally bought that.",
        "I enjoyed it.  I went in there, after watching your review, expecting to hate it - but I really liked it, even better than the first one.  Oh well!",
        "wokeanda forever",
        "They should\u2019ve made it with an all white cast so I can relate better. #thelittlemermaid",
        "Batman is still more cool than Pantherman..!",
        "Damn. They had such a GOOD start! How tf did they fumble it that hard????",
        "When Pixar was good, they had a sign in one of the hallways that read, \"Story is King.\" Pixar seems to have forgotten that, and many studios never learned it.",
        "At this point I don't think Disney marvel can withstand too many more \"cultural events\".",
        "Nobody has a problem with Peter Parker dumpster diving tho",
        "You can call me nanour\n nah gay fish",
        "The whole unrealistic supergenius female scientist trope is tired. The 'we need more women in STEM' nonsense is tiresome. There are hardly any women in rubbish collection and sewer work, we should have female Marvel characters that are really competent at collecting rubbish and cleaning sewers to promote more women in those jobs.",
        "Weapon injuries back then: lightsabers, gunshots, and spears are lethal if not paralyzing \nWeapon injuries now: \"tis but a scratch\"",
        "Even if Chadwick didn't die,  it still wouldn't explain all the plot questions.",
        "This movie is what you get when Chadwick isn't there to say \"We don't do that here\"",
        "The number of time Chadwick Boseman has thrown the spear in this video is mind blowing",
        "Namor: I need to kill this little 19 year old Genius\n\nShuri: I cannot let you do that.",
        "The antagonist isn\u2019t like Aquaman, he\u2019s completely different, he only lives underwater and is named Hydroboy. Completely different.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t even pirate MCU content, it\u2019s not worth committing bandwidth to it. THIS is how you stop piracy, release the worst things possible.",
        "Who is really really watching this action graphics video game movie.  Hollywood magic wand  at its finest and meaningless.  Lol.",
        "Not a mess, a failure  and possibly the  death of the  franchise."
