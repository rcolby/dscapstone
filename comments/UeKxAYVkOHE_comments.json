Thank you so much for talking about women in the gaming industry. Considering how much of an impact music and especially video game music and video games in general have had on my life, it also hurts me to think about how many hardworking (many pioneers in their field) creators and developers will ultimately not get credit for their work and/or get lost to time.

Take the second attempt for example. You didn't struggle because you fought wild Pokemon but because of the unfavorable matchup. I guess I understand if you wanna try without, and sure it adds a challenge, but it essentially enticed what we've seen - rocking up to a pretty hard rival fight with a level 5 because you can't afford to waste the PP to switch train, then having bad luck and getting the one Pokemon that's levelled properly hard-countered",

That doesn't make it any less mind blowing, but I guess it also means we should thank these content creators for giving it publicity.
