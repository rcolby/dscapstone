        "Im so sorry for your loss. Breeding (or whatever you are doing) is so hard for this exact reason. Nothing is ever promised and things can and do go wrong. If you are really serious about breeding (or whatever) and being responsible and ethical then PLEASE, get all the pups and mama OFA tested and make sure futured studs are as well and everything checks out good. I have watched and loved you guys for so long but id never be able to support anyone backyard breeding, especially those who have such reach. Doing OFA is so important as it can tell you how healthy your dog is health and body condition wise. PLEASE look at the OFA recommendations for Goldens and OFA these pups and any you may have in the future. Holding people responsible for having responisble breeding practices and breeding only healthy dogs is how we are going to end the overcrowding and overflow of shelters.",
        "Awww sorry for loss Daniel. The puppies are cute. Congrats",

        "Sorry for your loss. There was nothing you could have done to prevent it and you did the best you could. It's always a possibility, especially with a litter this big.",
        "For the little runt, I would recommend you weigh it every 3 hours and if he isn\u2019t gaining weight you will need to feed with a syringe and a Miracle nipple every 2 hours. Don\u2019t feed the babies with cows milk, use goat  milk instead. Before you try to hand feed the little runt, I would remove some puppies and make sure she or he is latching on mom and gets her milk",
        "Thanks for sharing this experience with us love it",
        "Oh Daniel. I\u2019m crying with you. I. So sorry for the one you lost ",

        "Breaking my heart. I'm sorry you had to go through that. I 've lost puppies myself. Take a pic of her. You've got this.",

        "I hate to be that person but seeing those puppies... this was definitely planned. I'm glad they are all healthy (Save for the little one that passed, sorry for your loss) But I do hope this brings some sense into you guys to stop \"accidentally letting your dogs get pregnant\" or at least be upfront about breeding them with purebred dogs. First it was Lark with a husky and now Monty with a golden. You guys have all the resources to do so much good in the animal world and educate people about rescuing and responsible pet owning. Best wishes to all of you but especially Monty.",
        "Daniel you\u2019re such an amazing soul. Watching how much you love Monty and those babies makes me so happy and inspired.

She hid away in the laundry room and when I passed by I noticed some blood and she was whimpering. She had one little boy and he was stillborn. My mom tried to help him but there wasn't anything we could do. About two years later she got pregnant again and birthed 6 healthy babies. We thought she was done at 5 and we all went to bed at about 2am....I got up for school at 6am and checked her, hello number 6! Funniest part was her first in the litter grossed my oldest brother out. I mean he is a father of 3 now...he was there for his sons c-section. But he couldnt handle seeing a dog give birth ",

The puppies look so cute and i feel relieved for monty that she doesnt have to carry around that weight anymore!! \nMaybe it would be good to at least get dna/health testing done on the parents just incase it was something genetic that caused this? I know even good breeders lose their dogs sometimes and you did so much to keep Monty healthy during pregnancy but there are things one needs to test for to know what's being passed on to a future generation.",

        "Why didn\u2019t Joey talk about the lost dog at all??",
        "I am so sorry for your loss. It\u2019s hard caring for animals and their babies some times. I own doves and I recently hatched an orphaned egg. They were doing great for the first four days, chirping and eventually opened its eyes. They got their first look at me who was caring for them and I was excited! But suddenly the next day they passed away. I say they because it\u2019s impossible to know the gender a dove is until they are at least a month old. ",
        "Awww Congrats for the babies and RIP to sweet Snowball. Daniel you are an awesome fur daddy and take such good care of Monty. Get ready for the adventure of being a fur grandpa \ufe0f\ufe0f Glad you have Joey with you. Monty definitely keeps you on your toes! ",

        "I don\u2019t want to be a Donna Downer but I am so frustrated that you brought 12 puppies into this world while THOUSANDS of dogs a day are being killed in Southern California specifically! As a dog lover it just isn\u2019t making sense. I saw 4 dogs under the age of 3 who have been in shelters for many months get euthanized yesterday because no one came to foster or adopt. Not because they had issues or were unadoptable\u2026. Please foster or adopt ESPECIALLY in California or South!!!! ",

        "Runts will not always be present in a litter. Even if a litter has dogs of different sizes, the smallest one does not necessarily become a runt. Even if smaller, it may be as healthy as and strong as the rest of the litter.",
        "What a wild ride of emotions for you all. I felt the excitement, happiness, sadness and joy right along with you. You and Joey were amazing through it all! Thank you for sharing this journey! Love you both!! ",
        "I'm confused are there 11 puppies or 10? Because Joey said the one that they thought wasn't going to make it, do to being out of the sak was resuscitated, and Daniel says that one was cold and they tried to resuscitate but the puppy died. I also heard in one of the previous videos that the vet said Monty was going to have between 9 and 11 puppies and she did have 11. So are all the puppies alive and well?",
        "I\u2019m so sorry Daniel about \u201cThat Puppy\u201d that died",

        "Congratulations  papa!  I\u2019m glad Monty is doing well.",
        "Sending love!!! ",
        "Believe me I can relate as far as the Snowball situation. My dog had puppies at the vet. One of them was put down immediately because of some deformities. One of the four remaining puppies was a merel (not sure how to spell that) and he was the runt of the litter. I tube fed him and put him on a heating pad. He started to look better. But on day 2 I came downstairs to my dad crying and\u2026 the puppy had passed. He tried for an hour to resuscitate it but it just wouldn\u2019t work. We buried him next to our old dog in the backyard. My deepest regards and condolences to Snowball and may she Rest In Peace.",
