        "Seeing Heinicke Cheering and aggressively celebrating as Robinson Jr. is fighting the entire Eagles front to cross the plane was inspiring!! I'm no W.C fan but that was a good football moment! A fired up QB and a never give up never surrender RB? Good Luck opposing team. 8-0? Try 8-1 son!",
        "That was a good game. Good defense by Washington to get 3 turnovers and some third down conversions on the road. That 58 yarder was an omen. Then he kicks a 55 yarder! Wow. ",

        "Well done Washington,  great win",
        "Any given Monday. A nearly perfect first half by the Redskins. Almost everything was working. What a game! Heineke really gives this team so e fire. Hopefully they keep playing this good. Hat's off to the Eagles also. They're  tough to beat.",

        "Congrats on the flukey win by the WFT with a lot of help from the refs. Games ending on bs penalties is a bad look for the NFL. Good for Vegas though. ",
        "From every Giants fan, thank you Redskins.",
        "Proud of young Jalen Hurts, this loss wasn't on him, though he will tell you different. He tried and had no idea the rest of his squad would cough up chances to actually win this game. From the INT that hit AJ in the hands and AJ handed it to the DB, Goedert coughing up the ball despite the face mask, Watkins coughing up the ball instead of either staying down or just run under the ball and not dive and get back up, Refs tacking on more yards for a \"late hit out of bounds\" or Brandon Graham sliding into Heineke at the end of the kneel down. Eagles did everything to hand the game to the Commanders and young Jalen Hurts still fought. Oh well. You play stupid games and win stupid prizes. Hot L served to Philly. Congratulations Commanders. Yall bet not let Wentz back as the starter, where so many fans made excuses on why Wentz was getting sacked and not doing so well meanwhile Heineke is playing way better than Wentz. But he makes all the money so, what will the front office do now?",
        "Smii7y's editor is cultured, in a whole lot of ways B-)",
        "Tremendous upset by the Commanders. Giant's fans thank you.",
        "Eagles fan here. Very sad loss but it was a hard fought game. Those fumbles from Quez & Godert rlly hurt. Hurts played his ass off and so did Heinicke. Excited for both teams futures... Still very upsetting tho.",
        "Eagles had plenty chances to take the lead before that penalty. Hell of a division road win by the commanders.",
        "Great win for the Commanders! They put a licking on the Eagles!",
        "Personal foul = Bullsh t call. Eagles were robbed. Refs had $ on the commanders fo sho!!",
        "Pov you came here to see who would be the first team to beat the eagles",
        "The comedic cut from him screaming to him suddenly on his last lifeline seemed very Lixian esque and I cant stop laughing  :-)",
        "How about that",
        "Eagles gotta hold on to that ball. Great job W",
        "What a great win Washington.  That Was one  heck  of a Performance.  Im a Bills fan , but you all just might make me a fan of commanders!  Great Job enjoy .",
        "Glad to have Lui back to the crew, this was such a great and remarkable moment for everyone.\n\nAnd that damn High and Squeaky voice. Just ah. Very Nostalgic.",

        "From Cowboys fan:  Great game Commanders the  NFC East Division is fun to watch again",
        "Is it me or were there a ton of bad spots by the refs on the commanders",
        "nice game",
        "I've always said, Washington is one of those unpredictable teams just like the lions, u never what kind of team ur gonna face, great win for them",
        "Smith's lateral attempt won me my fantasy matchup...",
        "I love how much time they take off the clock with these long drives, like the one drive that took 16 plays, but was successful. Go Commanders!!",
        "SPECIAL TEAMS",
        "Like I tell someone on fifa online wen I win na na hi hi good bye",
        "Heinicke should be their QB. The way the team rallies around him when he plays should show that the commanders are his team. Wentz just doesn\u2019t seem to get that kind of energy from his team.  Ron Rivera even said the issues were with QB when Wentz was playing, only to \u201cback out\u201d of that statement when realizing he basically calling out Wentz their big money acquisition. ",
        "Unfortunately it seems that the Washington Redskins have the magic formula when it comes to beating undefeated teams from Pennsylvania as they ended the Steeler's 11-0 streak a few years ago also!!!",
        "After an impressive win tonight, Washington has a pretty good shot to make the playiffs",
        "Hurst just showing he is not an elite QB that's all",
        "Alot of people including myself are happy that the Eagles are no longer undefeated. Way to go Commanders",

        "Heineke is almost what Tim Tebow should have been in the NFL. Able to make plays and go get that win when your team needs you.",
        "I hate the Eagles DBs play so far off the ball. #firegannon",
        "Goedart was NOT down, wtf? Should\u2019ve been fumble recovery TD. I Guess ball doesn\u2019t lie",
        "awesome win",
        "Was not expecting the L, definitely not from the commanders",
        "Washington really entered the blind ref cheat code.",
        "Ravens fan here. Good win commanders.",
        "I am not a Commanders fan but their  sideline energy is amazing",
        "Yes",
        "Washington is not going anywhere.",
        "That was a big brain play by Heinicke at the end.  He knew they were pumped up and ready to hit him so he took an early knee when he saw them coming knowing they would still try to hit him down because most people in the moment forget the rules.  I can respect that!",

        "Great Football play to seal it.",
        "That Knee by Heineke was the most big brain play I've ever seen.INCREDIBLE...! ",
        "How embarrassing a team who is not been paying well beats a team that was undefeated lol its coming back to them",
        "LMFAO Philly gonna get greased by the Giants in the divisional round. Giants vs Vikings in the NFC championship game & Justin Fields will run for 150+ yards & the 9ers will lose by 1 point.",
        "That was no flag at the end. 2 seconds is not enough time to hold off on a hit.",
        "When I watched the end I was in shock when Washington was gonna win, and when the Eagles got the ball, one of them threw a interception and a easy touchdown 32-21, and hitting the GRIDDY",
        "It is the second time in three years that Washington go on the road and beat an undefeated Pennsylvania team after Election Day on Monday Night Football.",

        "The Miami Dolphins undefeated season will remain",
        "This is probably the greatest game I\u2019ve ever seen from a terrible NFC team. \n\nThat kneel at the end was F\u2019ing genius!!!! ",

Goedert literally  almost had his neck broke and they don't call it. That was a game changer. The refs can make or break a game depending on how they feel. Just like when the falcons lost to the bucs on a bogus call. Some of these refs is trash",

        "As a Giants fan that was an entertaining game. NFC East baby. Its on !!!",
        "I think the refs mismanaged this game towards the end. The commanders should not have been given that fumble recovery possession. The Eagles player had his entire face mask grabbed at a full speed pivot and then yanked downward while another commanders player grabbed on to his back and forced his weight on. With that type of violent face mask hold\u2026 no single player could still keep possession of a football\u2026 it should have been ruled as so with the penalties attached.",

        "It\u2019s so nice not having to listen to these two commentators on Sunday anymore !",
        "I'm not a hater or anything, but it's good to see a good but not superhuman eagles team finally run out of luck. I think they were a bit overrated. Definitely a good team though. I'm happy for Washington. They haven't had a good season since RG3...",
        "Hahahaha",

They looked good against their NFC East rivals, the Eagles, dropping them out of the ranks of the undefeated, with good defensive play and moving the ball offensively.  Well done.  In a way, I'm rooting for them to make the post season.  I like the play of Heinicke at QB.  He can spread the ball around and is pretty mobile.",
