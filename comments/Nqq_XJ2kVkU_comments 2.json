        "My dude rating a gen 2 team with snorlax number 4 hurts, like it\u2019s the single best Pok\u00e9mon in gen 2 bar none by a large margin. It entirely defines gen 2 competitively and it uses on literally every single competitive team in gen two(not saying it automatically it makes the team competitively viable and strong just cause it has lax, but saying it automatically makes it better than any team without a lax, which I would imagine makes it stronger than all the other teams just by nature of having the single most busted Pok\u00e9mon of the generation on the team)",
        "13:42 I know there were \"anime reasons\" why Ash didn't get Mudkip, and it went to Brock instead, but if he had at least a Marshtomp (cuz lets be real, Ash was barely evolving anyone during Hoenn nevermind fully evolving them), he might have done better in this league.",

Grounds are threatened by the teams coverage, waters lose to pikachu + Melm and Lycanroc coverage (ect.) \nYou even used a really weak example on showdown for a criticism too imo.

        "I knew immediately that you would put ash greninja at the top. He was just so good. That\u2019s the only season of Pok\u00e9mon that I have watched and it also made me very emotional when he left",
        "I would be curious to see if Indigo and Manalo teams were full 6v6, if they would change in the rankings. It would be hard to define for Indigo because Ash did a bunch of switching, but at the end of Manalo he had exactly 6 mons (which seemed to be a theme they kept from Gens 6-8 in order to build better relationships with them).",

This means that the full pressure will lie on the shoulders of both Squirtle and Pikachu. And a Electrical attack is critical to both Squirtle (who was unexperienced) and Charizard (who doesnt want to fight) so that leaves Pikachu against 3. Not the best odds.",
        "To be fair is sun and moon team is basically cheating",
        "My favourite \"good pokemon?\"-factor is lechonk",
        "15:23 we will never forget you pilot",
        "Since Wolfe didn't discuss it, do y'all think Ash's signature Sinnoh team (Pikachu, Infernape, Torterra, Buizel, Gliscor, Staraptor) ranks higher or lower than Ash's Kalos team? Despite my bias for Kalos, I think Sinnoh ranks higher simply because it has less overlapping types. Kalos has 3 flying types and 2 dragon types while Sinnoh has 2 ground types and 2 flying types",

        "I honestly think this video would've been better with his entire roster from the respective regions, or counting Ash's fight vs Kukui instead, or even Ash vs Paul. The alola team just feels so screwed over by this, plus I just think it makes more sense. When you go to worlds you don't look at the only 4 pokemon you bring, you look at all 6. I also think it paints a better picture of Ash's journey as a whole to look at it like this.",
        "I think Ash's team against Kukui and against Paul need to be analyzed as well. Both are arguably more balanced than his others teams from their respective gens and you miss powerhouses like Infernape and Incinaroar (ohh now I know why you didn't use it)",

I'm pretty sure it goes over what level Pikachu would be for each tournament that Ash had been in by the time MatPat released it, at least. Should only have to do some guess work for 1-2 after that.

        "Okay, but can we talk about how my boi pronounces \u201cUnfezant\u201d and \u201cGible\u201d?\u2026",
        "bro who says guyble",
        "Am I the only one that's not a fan of this Game Theory style editing?",
        "At 3:24 the description of Neutralizing Gas is just \"While the user is on the field, the effects of all other abilities of other Pokemon that are currently in battle\" ..... WHAT ABOUT THEM WOLFEY?? WHAT HAPPENS TO THE EFFECTS???",
        "wtf GUYBLE?",
        "So 2 questions. How much would these teams change positions if you consider the moves that Ash had on his Pok\u00e9mon instead of just what they can learn?\n\nWould you do a video about Ash's best battle frontier team?",
        "Is Unpheasant really pronounced like that? I thought it was supposed to rhyme with Unpleasant but be a pun ",

        "Guyble lmfao",
        "Whats wrong with unfezant? Seemed decent in the card game lol.",
        "The worst team is definitely gen 5. Holy shit is it bad. My mans has one fully evolved pokemon, and its the regional bird, alongside two completely unevolved starter mons. 3 of his pokemon could compete in LC (little cup) for crying out loud.",
        "What about dimond and pearl leauge",
        "Don\u2019t even remind me about black-and-white that show is atrocious one of the worst animes I\u2019ve ever seen just ever",
        "\"Hey! Ash team! Good?\" Has the same energy as Nemona's \"You! Me! Rivals! Yes?\"",
        "I\u2019m curious what you think about some of the other teams ash uses in earlier rounds of these tournaments like his pikachu, infernape, torterra, staraptor, buizel, and gliscor team in the lily of the valley quarterfinals",
        "some of these points kind of just seem like they are made under the same engine (even if the pools are restricted), in which case it makes more sense, but I think the teams do kind of play around differently in their own respective engines, but it doesn't show a big difference.\nI'd say that the gen 4 team felt like it was phrased the way it was for time (Ash used multiple teams in that one) and was ultimately judged on the version of the team which lost, and that team was more picked for its similarity to the gen 3 team, which feels dishonest because the Vs. Paul team vibed as a fair bit stronger. But that might also just be me misremembering. If it's judged by the \"all same engine\" method Wolfey might be right though, who knows.",

        "You pronounced Gible two different ways throughout this video, and somehow still managed to mispronounce it each time.",
        "wheres is Orange Islands?",
        "You should totally make a video on what ash\u2019s best competitive team would look like in vgc. Not including any Pok\u00e9mon he had temporarily or released, but everything he currently has either on his journey currently and back at Oaks lab. I\u2019d love to see something like that from you!",

        "Cons of Ash's Unova team:\n\n-Poor Offense\n-Weak Defense",
        "Ash could have brought Krookodile instead of Unfezant as his fully evolved Unova pokemon. Krookodile was his strongest pokemon in Unova, it's a shame he didn't bring it for this battle.",
        "I really do wish you would've ranked Ash's team against Paul... but I'm happy the Sinnoh team got so far anyway!\n\nmaybe you could analyze it in another video?",
        "Took him damn long enough",
        "editing goes nuts fr",
        "Honestly I think my favourite battle to this day is still Ash VS Gary and Ash VS Paul, those episodes were so tense, now that I think about it I\u2019ve never done a Paul Playthough team that would be so fun",

        "Interesting way to pronounce Gible.",

        "Oh man, I'm so disgusted about what you said about corphish how dare you, that's your opinion I guess and it's absolutely NOT valid lmfao. Been using corphish for years competitively, corphish with adaptability, aqua jet, endeavour, knock off and dragon dance and he is the perfect sweeper with a focus sash, he is also OP in the anime!",
        "Unova is the worst team",
        "20:50 HEY NOW PIKACHU DOESN'T COUNT after the WHOLE start of the video  hey well technically if you used the Kukui Exhibition Match team it would be No. 0, Journeys would be No. 1 and Kalos would be No. 2 \nBUT it was after he won so it still quote on quote ain't his league team so yeah no complaints",
