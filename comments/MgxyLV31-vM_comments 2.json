        "I remember the first time you both met and I already loved you as separate creators, to see you both come so far I\u2019m so proud of you all. There\u2019s so much more we could all say but just know we will cherish these memories this journey and your creations forever. You both saved so many of us in our own times of darkness as you did for each other and we\u2019re forever greatful. Knowing those shades have been with us brought me to tears and I\u2019ll cherish them! I hope we get a rebirth palette as a last hurrah but if not at least we have conspiracy forever! I love you both congratulations on finding your peace ",
        "I love that we all collectively watch this and feel some sort of relief from the day to day ominous bulllllish! Love you all, thanks Shane for this hit of much needed inspiration on this shitty rainy Tuesday. ",
        "Well maybe you guys shouldn\u2019t be commenting \u201cI\u2019m so happy for him even though I don\u2019t know him\u201d \u2026. He\u2019s literally just switching over to TikTok because TikTok gives him more views. It\u2019s not that he\u2019s taking time for himself . I love Jeffree but that\u2019s messed up to just only be on one platform because it serves you better because everyone\u2019s on TikTok nowadays it really takes a toll on the people that have watched him and were loyal all these years on YT . Like yes switch up on us because the times are changing . ",
        "Dayuumm.. I hope uploads sometimes.. I like watching longgg videos.. Like, Jeffery is a creative person.. I know n care nothing van out make up or whatever. But I do love the process of transformation.. I feel bad tht the negativity of ppl could mentally effect him like tht",
        "Shane Dawson, \nThank you for reminding us all of what a talented content creator you are. You know exactly how to hit right in the feels. I couldn\u2019t be more proud of your comeback. I\u2019m here for it! ",
        "i\u2019m honestly so proud and happy for jeffree for putting his happiness and mental health first over social media",

        "I think a lot of us needed this series. As much as I\u2019m heartbroken about jeff leaving YouTube, it\u2019s bittersweet because I\u2019m so glad he\u2019s finally found peace and seems genuinely happy!\ufe0f\ufe0f\ufe0f",
        "I literally want to hug Jeffree so bad! I really love him for who he is. Nobody is perfect we all make mistakes! He is human and people need to remember that. We are all imperfect beings!",

        "Shane Dawson's backwards cowboy hat is distracting",
        "I know neither of you will see this. But, this new series made me so happy and so sad at the same time. Like closure, almost? Jeffree was such a big part of my journey into playing with makeup and who really inspired me to be creative. Then Shane, you opening the door and allowing us to see the whole inside scoop was really amazing. After following jeffree since MySpace and seeing his growth throughout the years and then seeing this makes me genuinely happy for him. I\u2019m really sad that cancel culture made you feel like you couldn\u2019t release that palette, it\u2019s truly beautiful and I really wish it could\u2019ve been released. I\u2019m really glad Jeffree never turned his back on you too as much of the internet did. I hope you both continue in your healing and creative journeys and have the most fulfilling lives ",
        "Ryland has really become my favorite. He doesn\u2019t just hear, he listens and tries to understand which is all you can ever ask a person for. ",
        "I laughed so hard at the wasp part! Shane hollering \"IM STUCK!\" lmao",
        "The shade montage had me in tears. I\u2019m so sad that it didn\u2019t get made into a whole pallet. It is an end of an era. I\u2019m 30 and still as invested in YouTube as I was when I was 12. Missed you both.",
        "Seeing the beginning part of this, I'm a Xenninal. So I see and feel the 'Gen Z-ers' are so much more impatient and in a rush for NO reason.... They need to slow the hell down and take a breath... take stock....and calm....\nAnd so... it seems the Gen Z-er's have the attention span of a gnat. Got It! Thank you TikTok!",

I\u2019ll continue to watch your videos over to Burger and that\u2019s how I learned to do make up. What is watching you and I love your brand. I am really happy that you\u2019re happy.",

        "You guys are pretty much the only reason iveever watched anything on youtube.  Loved watching it! This has been an amazing series.",
        "All great things come to an end and all that's left is the legacy created. You guys, through the ups and downs, good and bad, have left something behind that speaks to people. It's not just makeup. It's not just social media. I wish you luck and love for your futures.",
        "Jefree needs to make a social media app, something verry similar to bebo my space and MSN with a hint of tiktoks element !!! Something we can communicate on but share our fucking world while constantly being in regular communication with eachother followers and friends, we need personal pages that we can decorate express communicate and give love to and also receive love to \u2661\u2661\u2661, the gap in the market is their and we need a new social media platform, something that's gona Impact us all respectfully and peacefully",
        "The drama of covid was intense. I do feel people displaced thier anger and it is so sad that mistakes were made into life changing events. However, everything happens for a reason. I am so happy and proud of both of you for finding peace for the first time. Cheers for finally being a peaceful happy and not a manic happy! Love y'all.",

        "This video gave me so many emotions.. I\u2019m heart broken that jeffree is leaving YouTube and that the pallete never came out it\u2019s the most beautiful pallet I\u2019ve ever seen and I would buy in a heart beat!!! Shane you are amazing at what you do plz never quit YouTube\u2026 so happy to see jeffree so happy I honestly think he deserves it\u2026 this whole series was a beautiful testimony to y\u2019all\u2019s friendship\u2026",

        "Hear me out... call it the rebirth pallet",
        "I really hope Shane doesn\u2019t quit YouTube. I have been in love with the amazing videos he\u2019s put out the past 3+ years. Shane if you do decide this is not the place for you anymore, please just go right to directing movies and documentaries. You have such a creative mind/POV and I love to watch and part take in these journeys  you",
        "all great things must come to an end\ud83e\udef6",
        "Jeffree has grown so much throughout the years since their first series not just as a businessman but most importantly as a person. It makes me proud as a fan. Thank you for doing this series, Shane. Thank you for sharing all this with us.",
        "Shane acts like he doesn\u2019t eat factory meat and slave coffee when he asks people if they feel bad for eating fresh ethically farmed animals",
        "Another sob story to sell nonsense",
        "I\u2019m literally crying i love u Shane! When it was the montage of the doomsday shades w the og names then jefree\u2019s repurposed names in new pallets made me cry like fuckkkk I love u Shane is all I can say",
        "Shane, you have a serious talent! You are so incredibly creative, comedic and real! Thank you for all of the effort you put into this series !",
        "I was in college when you guys started that series and pallet together. I hated my school so damn much and coming back to my apartment from classes on a Friday night after getting food from Chick fil a, taking a shower, grabbing a snack from the kitchen, making tea, and placing my laptop and goodies all on my bed, muting my phone with the lights dimmed so that I could sit back and watch the different parts of the series like a movie was truly what got me through. I LOVED the anxiety of waiting for you to drop the next part and the first reveal of the pallet, and don't get me started on my ass skipping my class so I could run online and try and get the conspiracy pallet for me and my sister...OMG the memories!!!!! We were obsessed!!!! Gosh, life is so different now for us all.",
        "I went to tiktok and stayed there for a year. Then I found out what those short videos to your memory and attention span. So Im back here and I feel like a lot of us will come back to youtube once tiktok dies out. And if it doesnt, so what? Your ride or dies are here.",
        "I'm so sad that people got Jeffrey to this point. People are so cruel but honestly I love the growth.  I love Jeffrey and Shane together. Please don't ever delete the videos. I rewatch them when I'm sad. Yall are funny asf ",
        "Why does he talk like that",
        "Hopefully one day we will get this pallet! It is beauty",
        "Music was too loud thru out the series..",

        "Great Video",
        "Its so sad that them getting 'cancelled' & getting so much hate ruined their lives , They were my favourite YouTubers and it hurts that they\u2019re moving on now \u2026 I just can\u2019t get my head around it .",
        "Shane u need to find what is your passion if u lived ur series and YouTube u do u\u2026 if u wanna drop a pallet then u do that!! Do u!!",
        "I remember when Jeffree first launched his cosmetic line -- three liquid lips in shades Prom Night, Redrum, and I'm Royalty; when Jeffree revealed his bare face for the first time ever on YouTube; when I met Jeffree at Warped Tour and he only had a handful more lip shades, the Beauty Killer palette, and recently revealed lip scrubs. His Youtube journey was incredible to witness. There is no denying he changed the game for everyday, wearable makeup and other competition on and off the platform. It was a rollercoaster ride, but it's comforting to know he is at peace and can confidently admit YouTube is not fullfilling. Many other creators convince themselves no one cares, their content isn't good enough, the community is dying, but Jeffree rode the train and has found his stop. He knows when to call it and move on, a gift of intuition.",
        "I would have loved to see this come out\nYou both are so talented \nAnd I\u2019m sad Jeffrey was so hurt by the people on YouTube\nI love you both I hope you do colab again",
        "terrible camerawork jfc",
        "I\u2019m so sad!!! I didn\u2019t want to stop watching them together ",
        "Im definitely going to miss watching Shane and Jeffree videos together!!! It\u2019s crazy how their journey turned out! Time goes by so fast! ",
        "Mental health should be more important than anything. Even if it means disappointing loyal fans. Cause if they're truly loyal, they'd be asking for jeffree to take care of himself. \nKeep him close, Shane ",
        "I understand why Shanw is sad about Jeffree not being on youtube anymore. Because when we say youtube, Jeffree is one of the youtuber that will aitomatically come to mind. We are so used to seeing him when we open youtube and now that he would not be there, it is really sad...",
        "I felt sad when Shane said \"but I am not on TikTok so we won't make stuff together cus he is my favorite person to make stuff with\" their friendship ",
        "Please come out with that pallet so I know what I want for my birthday ",
        "The ads killed YouTube",
        "They can be friends outside of YouTube tho",
        "THE BARFING SOUND HAHAHAHA I guess me and everyone else rewatched that part half a dozen times.",
        "I'm sad. But I'm glad he's doing good. Maybe they'll put another pallet together later on. Hopefully,they will record time together once in awhile. Its so fun to watch them all together.",
        "I can't imagine that conspiracy is not around anymore does that mean I can't get it anymore because I literally was in tears because it sold out and that was literally just a minute ago I don't understand God has time flying like that without me noticing",
        "i'm so sad, the pallet is so pretty i wanna buy it",
        "Us millennials really don't like all this social media changes ",
        "People act like it's so crazy to raise and eat your own livestock and produce. Like..",
        "I miss3d this duo ngl",
        "rylands emotional IQ is incredible, you really lucked out with having him as your partner ",
        "I think I can speak for all of us when we say WERE SAD IT WAS NEVER RELEASED  but you guys are better for it, both are happy and thriving and that\u2019s all we want ",
        "That would\u2019ve been such an amazing pallet because the creativity is there. It\u2019s a mix of both of them. I wish they would\u2019ve came out with it. Automatically I would\u2019ve had a two to cart one for me and one for my Bestie",
        "Lol at the sad music playing when talking about leaving Youtube... like nobody's died people.",
        "Shane. This series was so special. Please do not wait so long for another one- WE ARE READY! this has such a sad somber ending but it also feels like new beginnings are on the rise. The palette is beautiful. Although we won\u2019t get our hands on it, you created a work of art and it should be treasured forever. What\u2019s next? The tik tok life of jeffree star? The life story of Jeffree star from MySpaced to yakkin? We are here for anything. I\u2019m so ready",

        "Please put this pallet out! Call it Rebirth or Renewal",
        "I hope you all know how much you mean to ALL OF US. Literally have grown up with you. Cancel culture is absolutely disgusting, and I am SO proud of yall for moving forward from all of it. \ufe0f this was such a heart wrenching series. love yall!!",
        "I\u2019m sad that you guys can\u2019t release the palette, I think that this palette would be amazing as a reminder of what these past 3 almost 4 years have been, it\u2019s even more crazy that you guys started creating it before the craziness even started!!! (All the shade names kinda make my mind explode ) That is definitely ICONIC in my head.",
        "I love watching your series with Jeffree star it made me excited to start my business and I watch them over and over again to continue to love doing my business",
        "Absolutely love you guys together there's no way he could be quitting you to I know I still watch YouTube and I absolutely still enjoy it",
        "many people could only wish for a friendship that strong like Shane and Jeffree's! I love them so much and their content always brings a smile to my face  Thank you Shane and Jeffree for enriching my life, I am truly blessed to be able to witness y'all ",
        "i love shanes youtube bc he posts long videos WORTH the wait.",

        "I love you tube. Always will!",

        "I can't imagine YT without Jeffree\n :(",
        "I love how humble jeffree is here. No makeup, no fillers, truly an icon",
        "Thank you for this Shane. It took me back to 2019 and how wonderful of a year it was. It will always be my favourite year in my life. I remember getting the conspiracy palette and crying because I\u2019ve been with you since you started YouTube and it was so amazing to see what you accomplished. I cried when you revealed the Doomsday palette because I so badly was hoping from the first episode of this series this would be your reveal. And it was, just not the reveal we had all hoped for. It\u2019s a beautiful palette and I hope one day it is released. ",
        "This was the Jurassic Park sequel I didn\u2019t see.. Jefree Goldblum lookin real different",
        "11:21 has me DEAD\n25:51",
        "Jeffreeeyyyyy Star I think so many will miss your talks and honesty WHY bc in the fake culture we see everyday, is refreshing to see REAL PPL.  I think the ppl who make vids for views & $$ to cancel or speak lies showed be the ones to e canceled & rethink their lives hurting ppl. Know they are the 1& done & no one knows their name , but bc if your honesty & realness m, you won\u2019t be forgotten.  The ppl who stick with you & know that those are the ppl I\u2019d rather live this human experience with .  Not the fake loosers!  Hopefully a lesson in those ppls lives words cut deep, don\u2019t speak unless it\u2019s real & nice. Society is over assholes who tear ppl down . We all have real souls! Think !  BE BLESSED KEEP SPREADING LIGHT!",
        "They all have names.. #147, #293, #305  \nSustainable living is the best! People get mad we kill elk, deer, bear or catch fish out here in Oregon but they just don\u2019t know what their missing!",
        "I care about everything you guys have posted. I will always support you no matter what your choice. It\u2019s not fair to have people make you guys feel like shit. Do what makes you happy. NO MATTER WHAT",
        "This series was so needed and the raw emotion that is in this video is such a closure that I think we all needed. Shane thank you for making these series because they brought me out of so many dark places and I hope that you can understand how much of an impact you have on people. Thank you Shane you saved my life more than once and I don\u2019t know what I would do without your videos<3.",

        "\"I feel even closer to you now than I did then...\" \"Yeah, absolutely.\" OMG i love you two forever and always. Thank you for your friendship and for being so real... I love to see how far  you both have come. Can we get that palette though? LOL",
        "Omg. Shane called jeffree daddy he needs a daddy not a ryland",
        "this is actually sad..",
        "Hi",
        "In regards to views, I feel like you need to remember that your fans are growing with you. I\u2019m super busy now and have my first baby on the way - I can\u2019t sit down and binge watch videos all day like I used to \ufe0f It doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t love and support you guys, some of us just don\u2019t have the time anymore.",
        "I get so upset every time creators talk about who nobody\u2019s watching YouTube because there are some of us that are against the whole \u201c short attention span\u201d and \u201cinstant gratification \u201c trend like myself and I literally would watch a day in the life of Jeffree over 500 tik toks any day:/ I don\u2019t even feel compelled to download that app cause it\u2019s just not my thing. And I know there are others like me.. I can\u2019t be the only one.",
        "44 mins into it, I get it. I understand why Jeffree is so happy and at peace. This is so awesome, thank you for creating this series Shane ",
        "I just hope you and Jeffrey know how incredibly meaningful you are to your fans. I have been watching YouTube since I was in high school. I fell in love with you both while attending college. When Y\u2019all finally made a collab and did full circle project. I was completely excited. It hurts to see two amazing creators have to rethink their careers due to drama/gossip. If anything it just shows how you have evolved. Be proud of being influencers who paved the way. Without both of you, this community would be nothing. Just another loyal fan. ",
        "tbh i hate the internet. people dont realize that theyre human too. people on the internet are so quick to judge and put down influencers because of their mistakes, but dont sit back and realize that they have also made mistakes in life and arent the best person in the world. like sit back and judge yourself before you look at influencers and judge them. nobody is perfect. everyone makes mistakes or does some wrongs. its life. this series makes me happy to see how much you guys have grown and how happy you guys have become. yall are amazing & deserve nothing but happiness in life. im super proud of you guys & what all you have done. ",
        "You know I find it to be the most saddest thing ever incorrect grammar whatever that Jeffrey's leaving YouTube he's hanging up his hat like in my mind I started as an adult becoming more confident in my makeup choices because of Jeffrey and I fell in love with Sheen and Jeffrey's friendship and the entire process that they went through and making the conspiracy palette so like my heart hurts a little like I've watched these people become these really good friends and it kind of shatters my heart that what in my brain ID the queen of YouTube which doesn't even make the right title it's not extravagant enough or anything what have we done so horribly that the Queens retiring crown and that's it makes me want to cry",
        "Shane and Jeffrey should switch lives for like three days and have to do what the other person does. Like Shane post on tik tok and Jeffrey do YouTube and podcast.",
        "They should have released the second pallet !!!!",
        "This video was very bittersweet, but I\u2019m glad that Jeffree FINALLY found peace and happiness, and that both Jeffree and Shane are mentally good. Not gonna lie, I actually cried just seeing Jeffree seem so free from all the toxic shit. I hope nothing but for more mental wellness and tranquility for the both of you ",
        "OMG the wasp ",
        "This genuinely made my heart hurt...I feel like there should be a part 2 pallet to show the growth yall have had <3 it would be everything.",
        "I teared up at the end Feel so bad for Shane. Not releasing this beautiful palette he's so proud of and all because of this f***ing cancel culture. He's put his heart and soul into this palette, and it really shows...",
        " that pallet looks amazing",
        "Wow my mind is so blown when you talked about the 2nd pallet. It would of sooooooo sold out because what a timing with the pandemic",
        "I\u2019m only a couple minutes into this part but it honestly makes me so sad because I am someone who loves long form content. Yes I love tiktok but I\u2019m a YouTube girly through and through. I 100% respect the decision to leave YouTube but to say no one cares is upsetting. 1 million views is still so many views for YouTube. Maybe 1 million isn\u2019t a lot for tiktok but YouTube it\u2019s still a lot. And those million people are probably the die hard fans who have been there through it all.

I need this in my life so- I've been watching Shane for 10+ years (since skit days) and followed Jeffree since the fruit loops MySpace pic.... like two worlds collided when this original docuseries dropped ON Jeffree. And when the makeup collection came out I was in a financially abusive relationship... I wanted and PINED after the collection bc I was working 2 full time jobs to pay the bills bc my \"man\" at the time would rather play Xbox than hold down a job. When I finally was able to I bought the BRING IT BACK mini version, the conspiracy, the collectors lip set and the lime green pig mirror. Unfortunately 2 years later I found myself in a physically abusive relationship that resulted in law enforcement being involved and me essentially becoming a ghost and in the midst of that, my conspiracy pallette was sacrificed to a grave of forever living in the truck of the psycho who tried to kill me. And the first thing I spent my \"free\" money on, as in- my bills are paid and my dogs and myself are fed and I still have spending money- was on replacing my conspiracy palette and I still to this day hold each piece of that collection as if it were gold. Guests don't touch it, but get shown. I visit it often and use it almost everytime (on the rare occasion) I wear makeup. It's everything ",

Thank you so much.",

I can't tell you how many times I cried to that song. I got the conspiracy palette the minute it released. I  remember sitting in my fiance's bed refreshing and refreshing and refreshing. Since then so much has changed. I've moved, I'm single, lost 50lbs. Got into spirituality. I've just... changed. I don't do makeup the same, I mean. it's all just so different. Hearing Jeffree talked about leaving YouTube and being so happy about it while Shane was still hanging on it to it really spoke volumes to me. I've been the person who has let go and moved on, and I've also been the person wanting something to stay.  But Jeffree said \"I evolve and shed my skin so quickly, maybe more quickly than others\" it really resounded with me. I have changed so much since the first series, I'm still me, but I am so different also. So much has changed and we have all grown so much. I really loved this series, I missed it. it was nice to get a taste of my old life back. I miss it sometimes.",

No one In my life has ever paid attention to the specific things I adore truly. When the conspiracy pallet was launched I kinda figured I was too late to order it because I\u2019m usually to late to get things or don\u2019t have the money too. My boyfriend of 6 years knew how much I love Shane Dawson and for my birthday that year he surprised me with the pallet. I wish I was lying when I say I cried for 30 minutes straight to have something from someone I love so much and the fact that he knew how much it meant to me. It was an emotional break down. I love you Shane and I think I can speak for all of your supporters when I say we need someone like you when days are rough. Thank you",

Watch y\u2019all entertain. It was fun for you as well us for us! During the time you were \u201ccanceled\u201d was a dark time for me. I lost my father during that time to lung cancer. Not having the person who brought me joy through videos was so hard. 2020 was just a rough year for a lot of us! I really couldn\u2019t imagine being in the public eye for millions and going through what y\u2019all went through. I\u2019m proud of you ALL! I know it hurts to look back on what could have been. But like you said Shane, your in a better place now. And sometimes it take reflecting and taking a moment or year to focus on yourself! I am so so so proud of y\u2019all! I really hope to see Shane x jeffree videos in the future! And I wish y\u2019all nothing but the absolute best! Much love from this Knoxville, TN girl!! ",

Jeffrey\u2019s answers have so much more gravity to them and aren\u2019t as vacuous and acquisitive as they once were.  You can see that they are still close friends but in many ways Shane is still doing the same shit.  Good on Jeffree for giving the  to you tube.

You had the world waiting to see what was going to happen next while creating the Conspiracy Palette, my step dad who knew absolutely nothing and didn't give a shit about makeup was glued to the TV watching you create a historical collection. Thank you so much Shane for letting us all see the many sides of Jeffree through your series with him.

I get grounded when I go out in the woods or pastures. Animals have a special way with people and helping them heal. I really enjoyed this series!!!! Thank you Shane, Ryland, Chris, and Jefree for this awesome content",
        "The problem with series like this is that it always leaves me wanting more. But, this was a beautiful video series about growth and friendship and I am here for it!",
        "Been in depression for about a couple of years. Its then when i found out shane and jeffree's channels . Too much of people they let enter their lives made the dramadisaster. To be in rage, its suprising how the social media affected my emotions how the other influencers made me feel disappointed to these two. 2023 is coming. We should forget and spread love.",
        "Such a pretty pallet\u2026 so sad it didn\u2019t come out",
        "This feels like a perfect goodbye for Jeffree. The circle is now closed. We got to see Jeffree's journey through Shane! It was amazing!",
        "Omfg I just laughed HYSTERICAL at the wasp part. Holy shit ",
        "This was the finale? I didn't even know",
        "How about naming it \"New Chapter\"",
        "AHHHHHHHHH IM SO EXCITED!!!! I hope you guys like the finale!!! I'm so proud of this video and this unexpected journey. I hope you enjoy it as much as i do!!! <3333",
        "Why not just release the pallet who cares if the shades are in other palettes",
        "RELEASE THIS PALETTE :(((",
        "The internet is cruel, but the fans who really loved you never really left. It was so sweet and nostalgic watching this series. Conspiracy is still one of my favorite palettes. I loved Jeffree since MySpace and you since the beginning. I wish you both the best on your adventures",
        "u n jidion should collab",
        "Love you Jeffree will miss u.",

        "SHANE MAKE MORE MYTHS VIDEOS",
        "I\u2019m so sorry for what happened to you both. Naturally, I started to tear up at the sight of the doomsday palette. It\u2019s such a shame that such a beautiful collaboration was wasted because of cancel culture. I know you both made mistakes, but no one should be bullied to the extent that they want to give up. I love you both. I\u2019ve been watching you both since I was 13. If you guys see this, I\u2019m happy that you two can find peace ",
        "This video hits my heart in so many different ways \ufe0f all I know is I love you all and want you all to be happy and have the absolute best experience life can offer \ufe0f  I\u2019m so incredibly proud of you all! Currently sobbing \u2026 just know you guys are so loved and thank you for being there for me when I have been low. Always have y\u2019all\u2019s back \ufe0f I cannot believe that some of the colors I adore in those palettes were going to be originally in y\u2019all\u2019s part two. My literal heart",
        "REBIRTH should be a new pallet name",
        "Jeffree figured it out people have changed.",
        " The use of Narrowhaven\u2019s STUTTER is perfection here ",
        "It does break my heart about Jeffree saying that about YouTube is like millions of people are still watching but it\u2019s just not 30 mill or whatever, it still is 1-3mill. Idk I still watch and I love channels like Sam and Colby but they also have like subscription service like everyone is behind a pay wall. It\u2019s hard but tiktok is so easy to find things you love and smaller videos. Idk makes me sad, I don\u2019t wanna grow up anymore. I remember in highschool YouTube was my safe haven and now it\u2019s like empty\u2026",
        "Jeffree is YouTube! It is JeffreeTube.",
        "What about instead of doomsday, you called it gayday. You wanted something happy and you are both so happy and content. Im really happy for you both.",
        "It's so sad to see Jeffrey or any other youtuber feeling like their content is not worth it. I LOVE long term content. By shortening the content you put out you shorten the viewers attention span. Jeffrey, Shane, you guys rock and do what makes you happy because f other people's opinions. An opinion is like an a hole, everyone's got one...",
        "I loved everything about this, besides the separation, but it is not really a separation, maybe just a change. Change can always be good. Much love from Argentina.",
        "it made me cry. You have been the biggest part of my life forever. I\u2019ve watched you since I was like nine years old and I feel like I\u2019ve grown up with you. You\u2019re the big brother that I wish I had. Thank you for being such a big part of my life, I wish I could meet you. That is my biggest dream in life. I love you Shane.",
        "I love that you have each other \ufe0f your friendship is pretty",
        "The thing about \"doing a Jenna Marbles\" is that it really affected people in a terrible way.  I was completely devastated by her leaving and am still heartbroken and miss her terribly. I understand people need to grow and do what's best for them but the other side of that coin is the loyal audience who actually loves you.  It's a very unpopular opinion but I also actually have some resentment toward her for it. I LOVE her, of course, and I think that's where the resentment stems from.",
        "Genuinely sad. I adore JS, and so sad he\u2019s leaving YT.  Thank you Shane for another epic series!  Please don\u2019t you leave too\u2026\u2026.. xxx",
        "Awe man, of all the palettes from this brand, this is the one I would have bought. I'm sorry this didn't work out the way you planned, but the universe shows up for us in ways we don't know until we reflect on it. 'Doomsday' looked ominous for sure! I'm happy to see everyone doing what brings them the most joy. Good Luck *hugs",
        "the way I would actually buy that pallet so fast",
        "Put the pallet out its so stunning don't care if the colours are used in other pallets\ud83e\udd79\ud83e\udd79 do the collection please ",

        "I do not like Shane Dawson with makeup on. I don't know why. And I think JS looks better with the shorter hair.",
        "I cried  I feel so depressed after watching this.. I love seeing them together.. and why not make another pallet? Shane you loved doing it\u2026 and you\u2019re not cancelled anymore. Those who are still here, believe in you. I\u2019ve been a fan of yours since the early 2000s and never gave up on you. ",
        "i am in tears. i can't believe it is all coming to an end. what you both created had such a big impact on me. it is sad to see it all go, but i am glad you are both happy and coming to terms with everything. thank YOU shane and jeffree. thank you for creating something we will never forget.

        "Please do make more videos together tho, I love you two so much the series on the pallette was such a joyful time jeez those vids made me happy af. However I totally support the decision coz cmon people life is so fuckin short and social media is often such a negative place like get off your phone and start living \u2661",
        "I\u2019m ngl I would\u2019ve loved to still have this palette it\u2019s so beautiful and I love it but ofc up to you guys but I\u2019m sure we would all love to have this palette",
        "Wow I can\u2019t imagine watching the shades get repurposed. That scene made me so emotional. :(((",
        "Shane!!! Thank you for creating for us. Honestly the headspace you guys are in is exactly where I am also. I\u2019ve been through so much and it feels like this is the time to heal and focus on being happy. I\u2019m so proud of you both for getting to that place. ",
        "I think Jeffree is suffering from depression ",
        "I\u2019m so sad it\u2019s not a pallet I\u2019m obsessed I need it. I would buy it if y\u2019all decide to bring it fully out.",

        "Today I officially unsubscribed I miss the old Shane Videos these ones aren\u2019t my tea which is such a shame I would\u2019ve stayed subscribed but why Shane do you have to do so many videos with Jeffrey star so disappointed!",
        "The Evolution Palette ",
        "I love this version of Jeffree. I hope more people have these same realizations. Filters, Hollywood, and the media aren\u2019t good for the soul \ufe0f",
        "\ufe0f\ud83e\udd79",
        "It breaks my heart to see that all the work they put into that 2nd palette ended up getting broken up, like the end of an era. That copper shade was so beautiful. I'm so sorry that people couldn't take a shining star and had to dim its light. I'm glad you've both found your light again.",
        "Create a new pallete called REBIRTH \ufe0f",
        "I'm also sad it never made it to peoples hands .. I would have loved having that color story !",
        "I think the pandemic taught us ALL to slow down and reevaluate what\u2019s important. Sometimes peace and happiness is so much more valuable than a 20mil house and fame. I\u2019m proud of Jeffery",
        "Im only 3mins in but i feel like Jeffery only cares about who\u2019s watching. Theyve lost all care for the fact that it should be or used to be fun. I feel like Ryland and Shane do YouTube because they love it and you can see that through their videos. Thats why I still watch because you can see the care and love that gets put into it all.",
        "YouTube isn\u2019t dead. Long content isn\u2019t dead. You are just not a part of it anymore.",
        "While I\u2019m happy that you\u2019re all in a better mindset and content in your lives, this is heartbreaking. The impact you both have on us together and individually is unmatched. Following Jeffree since MySpace days and following Shane since the dawn of YouTube makes me realize how much you\u2019re both a part of me. You\u2019ve both got me through my darkest times and watching you both be real and transparent is what I needed. I\u2019m excited to see where you all go from here and can\u2019t express how proud I am of all you\u2019ve endured and accomplished. No matter what, we will be here to love and support your journey. Just know that I, amongst many others, will always love and cherish every moment you share/ shared. Bless you all. On to the next chapter, on to better things. ",
