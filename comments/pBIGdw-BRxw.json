", "What ? This is far fetched. I liked the humble gritty vibe of the first 2 . Now it\u2019s a big theater production. Nothing will ever be as raw as Channing dancing to Pony ! That was the best thing I\u2019ve ever seen. Period", "I'm gonna go see this for Salma Hayek. She's always wanted to do a movie like this, and this is just as much a passion project for her as it is for Channing.", "Salma makes me believe a woman can have whatever she wants, whenever she wants ", "This pure magic, can't wait to see it for once!

Shout out to Patrick Packing.", "I liked it. This is due to the success of the real-life live Magic Mike show that is in Las Vegas right now. The quick clips of the guys dancing on the stairs and the hostess dancing are taken straight from the Magic Mike live show for anyone who has seen the show in person or the recorded clips from audience members that have floated around on here. They extrapolated everything and it has culminated in this. Channing and his business partners did it. Now, this is the \"what if\" Channing's character, Mike Lane achieved the same thing. Perfect for Valentine's Day.", "This is fantastic news! Glad to be a part of this community and its awesome to see so many people coming together to help others. Mad props to Charlie and everyone who donated to help those who are unfortunate get back to living an actual life! You guys are awesome! :O", "Not gonna lie. This looks good and I'm here for it!!

Sure this film seems to be missing the ensemble but it seems like a neat character dive story into Mike's life while also having elements of a dance musical. I'm down for this (heh)", "Missing Joe Manganiello and Matt Bomer. Still this looks good!", "Definitely happy for those who want to watch the final Magic Mike film. ", "I\u2019m legit excited for this.", "Damn can\u2019t believe Magic Mike made a comeback!", "Just finished the first two movies and came here to watch the trailer", "I'm rewatching all his videos now that he has passed and that ending just really hits different. \"I'm free.\" The Great Potato War is what I believe is the ultimate display of Techno's true capacity in scary intelligence and shocking talent.
