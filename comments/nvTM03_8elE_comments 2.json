        "I feel like I need to get movie tickets for each Vaati & Mispap release!! ",
        "The cinematography here is simply amazing. You\u2019d almost think all these shots were from in-game cutscenes",

        "anybody every considered that dungeaters seedbed curse is kind of like what that amygdala in Bloodborne speaks of?\n\nif you don't no what I'm talking about, I'll just type the voice line here: \"Curse the fiends, their children too. And their children, forever true...\" ",
        "Only 1 episode left tomorrow! I hope you guys are ready :-D",
        "This masterpiece could even be showcased in cinemas.",
        "Broooo this is amazing",
        "To those asking what armor...\nBloodhound torso, nox bottoms(99% sure), and leather gloves.",
        "yooo vaati, this video is far beyond marvelous. The editing, pictures, scenes, sound effects, script, timing. You definitively polished your videos. gz!",

        "Comment",
        "Can we take a moment to appreciate how much time and work he puts into these videos for us ",
        "Order is not peace nor is it prosperity. Order is Order, regardless of the form it takes as long as things are structured, placed and controlled Order has been achieved and the Greater Will does not distinguish motive. Melinia could bring about the Order of Rot and that\u2019s fine, the Golden Order could be restored and that\u2019s fine all that matters is that chaos doesn\u2019t thrive.",
        "Tbh I feel both good and bad, to be able to watch this for free with this much quality, time and effort put into this it's just  wow",
        "The tarnished in this video is wearing my exact fashion in game. Down to the monk legs and hairstyle.",

        "Vaati showing off his builds in these videos goes to show just how deeply he digs into these games on all possible levels",
        "outstanding content, as usual",
        "Another Stellar Video Vaati. What a way to celebrate our GOTY winner   Elden will always have a special place in my gaming memories and these videos just make me fall in love with it all over again. Fantastic voice overs, editing and it helps bring my favourite gaming World to life ",
        "i find it incredibly intersting that although the dung eater was embracing defilement, in a way you could see that he was actually trying to revert life to its primordial state, rebelling against the modern faith yet embracing the roots of its origin, in which the truth of the primordial crucible was twisted to spur the upbringing of a new religion.",
        "This was amazing to watch, cant wait for you to tackle the other ending as well. I love how the dung eaters curse mantra is a call back to the Baneful Chanter from Bloodborne, \" Curse the fiends, their Children too, and their children forever more.\"",
        "Very funny how the automatic English subtitles calls Marika \"Queen America\"",
        "Elden Ring GotY",

        "\"Morgott tried to be the Erdtree's protector. He was never loved, and should never have learned love. But nevertheless, love the Erdtree he did.\"  \n\nThat's the line that did me in. That's the line that made my tears flow.",

        "You and your team put together an amazing piece of work here, Vaati. This is really top shelf stuff. \n\nThat said, Dung Eater can get stuffed. Prawn Bro for life.",
        "@Vaati, bro i think it is safe to say you should release an official audio book with complete elden ring lore, in a manner similar to silmarillion",
        "Your videos have always been great, but somehow they keep getting better. Excellent job as always.",
        "This could be its own indie horror movie",
        "What armor did he wear during the video?",
        "This is so neat!",
        "In past fromsoft games they\u2019d have made someone like the dung eater a misunderstood character. However I like the idea of someone being hated by everyone and when you finally meet him your realize that everyone was right.",
        "You are too generous to share with us this content for free. This is a cinematic masterpiece",
        "What\u2019s with this strange new style of videos",

        "VaatiVidya is the fallen leaf",
        "I cannot just watch this entire video and not praise the insane production value in it. You guys really go above and beyond with every video",
        "Honestly I love the video and a hats off from me but what\u2019s perplexing me the most, is WHAT ARMOR YOU\u2019RE WEARING like is leyndell knight like what is that armor?",
        "Wtf is this quality, keep up the good work.",
        "I swear at this rate his video on Goldmask is going to be classified as a feature length film (40 minutes+)",
        "Everytime I play, the dung eater dies in the sewers. Bogart must be safe.",
        "Mohg looks so sad at the end of this video.\nHis coming age, the Mohgwyn Dynasty, usurped by the Dung Eater of all people.",
        "This has to be one of my favorite lore video",
        "Vaati really said \n\"Who just reads the wiki? who does that?\"",
        "Ah, good, more fuel on my \"fuck the Golden order\" bonfire. \n\nAnd I had no idea about the Cut Dialogue for the noble, but he just adds to my dislike of Leyndell. The place always felt oppressive to me. All the gold and marble might look nice, if you're into that (gold is far too gaudy for me regardless, but the Marble is nice), but the place has an air too it that I can't stand. I think it's the Erdtree, to be honest. Its like living with a judgemental god breathing down your neck, watching every move. All while knowing there are people who's only crime was being born 'wrong' living trapped beneath your feet.",
        "Didn't expect to hear RicePirate here. I want to see FromSoft actually bring him in to voice in the next Armored Core.",
        "This is the intro From software needed for this game.  Thanks for explaining so well",
        "You have some of the highest quality content on youtube",
        "world class editing",
        "I have a few questions, not related to this video, but still related to ER. \nWhy are there so many runes found in cemeteries? Why are there specific names for some runes?(Lords rune, hero\u2019s rune, numen rune) and why when you lose your runes to dying, they look like little sprouts on the ground before you pick them up again? I just wonder if there\u2019s any special or lore reason.",
        "Fantastic work Vaati. Amazing content",
        "Holy production value batman",
        "Well done to everyone involved in making the prepare to cry videos, they are incredibly good.",
        "goatse vidya",
        "I'm just going to continue to link Vaati's videos to people that try to say Elden Ring doesn't have a Narrative.",
        "I'm only 5 minutes in, but this is already insane quality! I'm absolutely stunned.",
        "Dung eater main character",
        "Just when you think it can not be better you release this. Bravo my friend bravo",
        "The content in general is just becoming more and more elaborate/gorgeous. The cut content throws me off a bit because I wonder if I missed something but it's still so cool to see!",
        "I had thought the dung eater had buboes, but its not, its cut horns...",
        "You should be proud of this video man. Wow.",
        "I love this. But I miss the old style lore videos.",
        "Whoever directed  and put together this trailer with the music needs a commendation",
        "Seriously these videos should get nominated for Grammys etc",
        "dude the production is insane. Bravo mate bravo",
        "I still wish Malenia and Miquella had their own ending tied to them, maybe if you defeat Mohg before Malenia it'd be interesting to be able to offer something to Malenia at the beginning of the fight, you could lead her to where Miquella is, I think it'd be quite interesting to see what an ending like that would be like",
        "Slight correction: GODRICK'S rune is the anchor ring, not Morgott's.\nGreat video. Slightly too long, but you can tell real effort went into it!",
        "this video is very good already",
        "What a beautiful video",
        "Piece of art",
        "I love this new cinematography format",
        "What is that armour you use through out this video?",
        "I hardly finish any Netflix episode, but this! This make me nail in place until the end.",
        "Great video!",
        "At 22:15 what does the dung eater scream?\nSounds like 'bless you' but that makes no sense",
        "Simply beautiful",
        "This was fucking incredible",
        "I was actually hoping to see the original Morgott cutscene. The 1.00 version had way different effects on the breaking sword that I think matches his dialogue better.",
        "Masterpiece",
        "The cursed ending is clearly the ending that leads to the dark souls universe. Just me?",
        "Wow, absolutely great video",
        "I got a question tho. If the omens were a product of the Crucible and the Crucible was the primordial form of the Erdtree, why does the Omen Curse damn souls away from the Erdtree and banish Grace?",
        "And yet people say, that ER stories are boring, graphics are bad, fights are not interesting...",
        "Love u man , u make me play this game again and again and agian with different view",
        "This was absolutely amazing, I loved every second of it. The cinematic shots along with the artwork and animation and the music go so well together. All explained with a calm and soothing voice along with images so the viewer doesn't get lost. It was incredibly entertaining to watch, from the beginning to the end! Props to everyone that worked on this, your work is extremely appreciated!",
        "I can't even begin to describe how much amazed i am. It was just so beautiful thanks again for this quality !",
        "Do you think that Seluvis's potion would have worked had it been used on a demigod who's soul wasn't circumstantially unbound from it's physical form. I always felt like his one miscalculation is that he asks you administer it to the one Demigod who doesn't rely on the corporeal form she resided in. He was trying to turn a puppet into puppet from what I gather.",
        "damn",
        "Your piece returning to Artorias brought me to humbling tears, overwhelmed by a well-told story bravery and sadness.  Here, a grown man, my eyes wide, I dared to wonder like a child.",
        "FINALLY A NEW ONE WE ARE WAITING FOR YOUR CONTENT <3",
        "The production value is just insane! Felt like a movie. Great job and please: MORE!!!",
        "Doc's natural instinct is to get involved and I don't think that will ever change. However, there were times where the comms, tactics & decision making as a duo with Courage were on point, and those were the games he fried.",
        "These are all just beautifully told. \nA golden age of lore :)",
        "Amazing work as always! Can\u2019t wait for the next video!!",
        "Made me cry in the first few minutes.  That\u2019s a new record by far and its cuz of the absolutely amazing art and setup.  Holy crap man this is awesome!",
        "I really don't say this lightly, but this art is amazing... Really, its rare that I am so blown away by artworks. This looks like it came directly from Fromsotfs amazing art-team. Really, wow...",
        "The only \"good\" ending.",
        "Time for crab! Perfect timing actually. I\u2019m eating crab Mac and cheese.",
        "This feels like a DLC. Insane production! ",
        "Holy shit",
        "Man, too much Dragonball, too little lore :(",
        "Masterpiece! And my favorite Topic Dung Eater is the Best",
        "You forgot the bit where grace is leading Godfrey to the player.",
        "You get such amazing footage of this game. Seriously over the top. Well done. Yet another awesome video",
        "Best ending",
        "This is some next level editing holy moly",
        "So what ending do you get if youve done the dung eater, the madness & rani's quest to completion? I will finish the game one day and get my answer I guess lol",
        "This reminds  me why I love Elden Ring  and such games. A love for the misunderstood  and outcast. Reminds me some of  the Dominican  Art style.... no wonder I love it too.",
        "Great music in this episode!",
        "If Elden Ring doesnt win Game Of The Year, it will be the biggest robbery in the history of gaming.",
        "I've developed a strange admiration for Morgott \nhe's a warrior comparable to his father, has skill with sorcery after his mother, and a king who is truly devoted to a path he thinks is best for the world.",
        "Cry a lot... check.",
        "Was the choice of using the new animation for Morgot's blade reveal a conscious lore related one or more of a thing that just happened because current patch was used to record?",
        "ER was the best game for me but the story's n lore do nothing for me",
        "I find the story of Dung Eater so hauntly wonderful yet so vile that i could not bring myself to do it. Thanks for the amazing video Vaati!",
        "I think a very ambitious and gutsy direct sequel to Elden Ring would be to make the Dung Eater ending canon. Then play as one of the cursed and misbegotten in a rotting Lands Between trying to rise up and end this broken Tarnished who took up the Seedbed curse and blessed this land with despair for thousands of generations",
        "so \ngood",
        "That one got me, I\u2019ve always felt bad for Morgott. I\u2019ve been watching your channel since dark souls one it\u2019s crazy to see how much the content has changed.",
        "the first song is so beautiful",
        "My guy rollo, been rolling in the deep",
        "Hardly comment on anything, but this might be the best video on a video game out there. The combine talent and passion of the people that made this happen... just amazing!",
        "What's the lore behind Margit not appearing if you kill Morgott but the one in Leyndell does?",
        "UNBELIEVABLE video, such a wonderful wonderful, what a creator, what a community",
        "You've really, really outdone yourself. This is insane production value and tugs at all the right heartstrings, while telling a complete story. amaaaaaaazing work. much love always\nmy favorite moments:",
        "You should be hired to be a narrator to a whole game fromsoft or not, such an amazing work, such an amazing talent, greetings from Mexico Vaati.",
        "Perhaps Serosh was akin to the omen, as if the power of the crucible (life itself and the great beasts it creates) was the true spirit in the body of  a man. Meanwhile, the misbegotten and omen are merely the outward fusion of life and men, to varying degrees. In the end, all are human but the hubris of sight plagued lyndell. To shackle the beast and force him to be a man before condemning all whose crucible blessings could not be covered was to doom Leyndell and the Greater will.",
        "Notifications set: ALL\nVAATI!!!!! THIS IS EVEN BETTER THAN YOUR LAST VIDEO DAAAAAMN",
        "Great GREAT video ",
        "A lot of work was put into this video , congratulations to all of you it is indeed a spectacle to watch , I even got goosebumps,  trully amazing Vaati.",
        "Ok just waow",
        "That is the best content you've ever made....wow...the quality....",
        "(In Marika's own words.) My Lord, and thy warriors. I divest each of thee of thy grace.\n\nWith thine eyes dimmed, ye will be driven from the Lands Between. Ye will wage war in a land afar, where ye will live, and die.\n()Then, after thy death, I will give back what I once claimed.",
        "The work that went into this....",
        "FUCKING AMAAAAAAAAZING GOD BLESS YOU VAATIVIDYA",
        "Wow you really stepped up the visuals for this one. Incredible video Vaati. Vaati and Miss Chalice crossover, when? Prayge",
        "Might be like top 10 videos on youtube tbh",
        "Dungeater seems like a fighter against the outer god. His curse may not be as terrible as people are led to believe to be by the Greater Will.",
        "The best so far\n1. Lord of Frenzied flame\n2. The blessing of despair \n3. Boss lore",
        "This is another level. Thank you Vaati and all who worked on this masterpiece.",
        "I noticed the crucible knight wing attack at about 35 mins, is that from the garden of eyes mod?",
        "How does he make videos this good? This is game footage for gods sake.",
        "after watching this , i don't even know how god of war ragnarok can compete with Elden Ring",
        "You're really a creative force of your own, yet I think what makes you stand out amongst YouTubers is your determination to pull together lorehunters, artists, hackers and editors to string together these remarkable tales. I'm so impressed at how you tied all these disparate threads together - this coulda just been a Morgott 'Prepare to Cry,' but you've really tackled so much in one go!",
        "Thank you for this amazing good night story",
        "Wait, the story is happening thousands of years after the shattering ? I though it was not so long ago",
        "Gorgeous! Amazing work!",
        "These games are more like books than anything else encompassesing a whole world with such deep and hidden struggles from soft is truely amazing im so thankful we get to see a studio actually deliver beyond expectations",
        "why are there omen if the erdtree denied the rebirth if them. ither its a curse from souls being rebirthed or the golden order is falsely determining what the erdtree will or will not be rebirthed into the lands between",
        "This is great, how dose he make those ingame videos I know that you can record yourself playing but, it is like there is another camera recording him while he is playing. I am not video editor so my knowlage is limited but this video peked my intrest because it is that good.",
        "Man, the sound effects and music synced with the footage here and the structure of the entire thing is just incredible, can't lie. Very impressed, the Margit part gave me chills",
        "Hot dang, you're really going all out huh?\nAnother cracker of a video, bravo to everybody involved!!!",
        "Oh, the dung eater's armor is meant to resemble broken horns? I just thought it was meant to look like giant bits of corn in a turd, you know cause like...well, you know! ",
        "This is top notch production.",
        "Damn mate, you made a masterpiece here :)",
        "Didn't realize that Agent Ward was Freyr",
        "Dung Eater has a point if you consider the Erdtree and the Golden Order to be the unnatural influence of an Outer God. There's nothing inherently wrong with being an Omen, they are just cut off from returning to the Erdtree and shunned as a result. It's the only ending that rejects the Greater Will without destroying everything like the Frenzied Flame.",
        "Godfreys tenderness towards Morgott presents him so well. I believe he had accpeted the aspects of the crucible from the beginning. Fighting side by side with the crucible knights. Teaching them to shatter the ground with a mere stomp and leading them to victory against many great foes. Godfrey himself was a tool unfortunately. Tamed by Marika and forced to abide her will, the will of the golden order. When he held morgott in his hands, it must have been painfull to him. Seeing as to what the golden order has made with his very own flesh and blood. And knowing that he was powerless to the very end.",
        "You missed this beautiful quote ,\"If the order is defiled entirely then defilement is defilement no more\".",
        "WOAH! I have just two words to describe this:' Holy S%#@!' One of the most impactful, that I have EVER seen! Genius, a work of art! Keep it up!",
        "Elden ring in a nutshell:\nMan with horns: cursed\nMan who has grafted hundreds of limbs to his own body:I mean he\u2019s fine",
        "What's the dung eaters accent? And... why? I'm no good at accents so it sounds either Australian or South African or like... Whatever accent that was in the original Fable game that called you 'chicken chaser'",
        "I liked the soundtrack and animation \nIt is amazing",
        "amazing",
        "this video is so well made",
        "kinda disappointed there wasnt any of mohg, although, getting a lot about morgott was still very awesome",
        "this is a masterpiece",
        "As always Vaati you and your team have done an absolutely amazing job.  From the beautiful cinematic shots, to the absolutely stellar lore friendly fight scenes. I have watched your videos since dark souls 3 and you have always left a wonderful impression. It's great to see how much your content has grown!",
        "I'm thinking I misunderstood the dung eater's questline",
        "Wonderful work, Vaati!",
        "wow \ni didn't even know there was another ending",
        "This is edited so well. Thank you. I wish game companies would makes movies like this.",
        "i'm just at minute 5 and a thing came to my mind: why the flying heck cant we never ever trade SOME sentences with those Lords? Like telling Melania where we found her brother, offering salvation to her misery ... these things would lift immersion again to another level. Maybe in another FROMSOFT game ;)\nok i keep on watching now",
        "God damn dude.",
        "Absolutely stunning. I wish FromSoft didn't hide so much of the story and lore from more casual players. I'm currently halfway through my first play through and it's so easy to miss the details of this wonderful setting. It saddens me that much of what went into building this world will go unnoticed by most players.",
        "What armor is that at 7:40?",
        "36:20 go hard af",
        "4:52  when I\u2019m down to my last piece of gum and my friends want it",
        "This honestly felt like a movie of its own. Bravo",
        "This was an incredible production. Thanks for the all the hardwork to everyone who participated in this. Souls community it\u2019s really something else.",
        "Excellent work, i really hope you do more, i especially want one about Ranni's ending (Iji, Blaidd, Seluvis...) and Fia's ending (|Both D's, Gurranq, Godwyn, Fortissax) , maybe even Goldmask (Cohryn)",
        "26:58 another awesome shot ",
        "Tremenda obra maestra 10/10, goty, oscar, pulitzer, nobel. Denle todo.",
        "I don't care how righteous people try to make the Dung Eater look. He's a monster and I will not let him defile my mate Big Boggart",
        "Dude you\u2019re amazing",
        "I missed the premier, and I'm not even finished the video yet, but this is easily one of the best looking videos you have ever made, and I'm so excited to see the future of this channel",
        "Finally I feel like this will give people a better understanding of Morgott\u2019s tragic story, the dung eater, and the age of despair ending. I\u2019ve always loved Morgott\u2019s character and many people don\u2019t even know his story so I\u2019m glad it\u2019s been told in such a amazing way.",
        "holy wow, this art is amazing!",
        "This video is incredible. The music is fantastic. I was glued to the screen. Well done to everyone who worked on this masterpiece.",
        "You guys did an amazing job on that Bravo",
        "Maybe the greatest single summary of the game\u2019s lore ever recorded. And to be done with such production value. Quite an achievement indeed. Bravo, Vaati. This one is for the books.",
        "Poor prawn guy ;-;",

        "this explains so much. isn't it interesting how Morgott's cursed blood is amber? maybe even the same amber which bleeds from the Elden Beast? and how fascinating that the Three Fingers exclaim their despair over the mistake made by the Greater Will, a mistake it wishes to wipe clean from the Lands Between in a cleansing fire that would melt it all back to its primordial essence, the Red Gold of the crucible.",

        "I feel like Morgott and Mogh weren't locked in the sewers always. I feel like Morgott was in fact out of the sewers way before the Shattering. The hammer he uses is the Giant Crusher. A hammer used in War of the Giant and later fell out of use which leads me to believe that he was out of the sewers way before the Shattering. Not to mention Morgott already having an order of knights by the time Godwyn was killed which we see in the trailer, the way he talks about his siblings as if he knew them personally (He is respectful with Radahn, hateful towards Rykard, mournful for Ranni, nostalgic for Miquella and Malenia and even uses Godrick's actual title), his way of speaking of them felt WAY too personal for him to just know of them by hearsay and I think he did know them and may have been loved by some of them, maybe by Miquella who loved the deformed ones and Godwyn who was ready to befriend Dragons. Not to mention that Morgott also created Sentry's Torches which means at the time Godwyn was killed he had to have authority over Leyndell's army. Not to mention that Mogh would have to know of Miquella's existence to even get to him and know where he was.",
        "Morgott is easily my favourite boss in Elden Ring. Not for his fight or the presentation or even the music, but his constant presence throughout the game. The Fell Omen, the Night's Cavalry, the scene with Godfrey holding his body and all inbetween. He's one of the few noble souls, fighting for what he believed in, who retained their sense of self all the way to the end.",

Here was something able to give people powers that were beyond those of any normal people, powers that if harnessed correctly, could come to pose a quite serious threat to its design for the Land's Between, and it was something that already had followers and belief vested in it, all things the Greater Will wanted for itself and it's Golden Order.

        "20:16 Geez, that's a pretty horrible thing to say... You do realize the game confirms in no uncertain terms what he does affects people who haven't been born. People who have, by definition, committed no wrong. \n\nRegardless of what is being done to the Omen, the Dung Eater is one of the few NPCs in FromSoft's library that is truly evil. He is causing pain and suffering for its own end, potentially denying people their afterlife, and he does so recklessly and without regard for anything or anyone.

        "There is an absolutly wonderful trilogy of mods for Skyrim, Vigilant, Glenmoril and Unslaad. These three mods are very much inspired by the soulsborne games but keeps everything within the Elder Scrolls universe and lore. The two main antagonists are Hermaeus Mora, daedric prince of knowledge and a mysterious figure known as the Anatomancer and it is astounding how close the themesbof the Anatomacer and thr Dungeater alligns even though the mods came out first. The Anatomancer is essencially the culmination of every single bad choice the player could have made durring the trilogy and is in a way us, the player. Both him and Mora wants to use the phenomenon known as CHIM/AMORANTH for their own, vastly different, ends. For those that dont know the Elder Scrolls universe is canonically a dream of the mind of the so called Godhead. Very few people in universe are aware of this and typically finding out yelds three different results: the most common is called \"the zero sum\" where you realize that you are fictional and your mind cant accept it and you are erased from the world. The second is called achieving CHIM, it is essencially lucid dreaming where you stand by your existance though sheer ego allowing you to change the dream around you (people who hs achieved this includes Tiber Septim/Talos and Vivec). Somewhat related to this is Amaranth where you fully accend and become a/the new Godhead. The third option is very rare and has arguably happened only once (fans specualtion includes more cases), the Sharmat, a person who does not believe they are the dream but instead the dreamer or the Godhead itself (Dagoth Ur is the only concrete case we know of, although fan speculate that Miraak could be another if only theme-wise).",

The Erdtree is clearly an allegory for Feudalism, the larger state from outside controls the raw materials of the conquered state, but due to the parasitic relationship, the entire thing inevitably falls apart at the seams. It's a pure mythological fantasy representation of reality. This perspective filtered through the lens of a genius game director from Japan and his infinitely talented team still leaves me in complete awe at the endless well of human imagination.",
