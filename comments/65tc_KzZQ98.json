Kinda wild to think of fashion that way for us nowadays but it makes sense. Louis XIV knew that courtiers across Europe looked to other courts on the continent yo help dictate what their own kingdom\u2019s/empire\u2019s court dress should be so they could be seen as their own independent governing power. So to compete with Spain & ESPECIALLY England given their long contentious history, Louis effectively tied a good chunk of the national economy to raw material cultivation, textile fabrication, garment making (hello, beginnings of today\u2019s haute couture!!), etc., so they could readily export all these products he would make be seen as valuable and drive up demand for by establishing a very highly aesthetic, super detailed (if not stringent) court dress to set France apart so when courtiers of other nations came to French court, they would have to get French clothing and then they\u2019d take those clothes back home with them. So with the fashion industry developing as quickly as it did in France, they needed to have people wear the clothes for fittings when the courtiers were out of country and to have illustrations, which were paper/art propaganda pushing the sartorial propaganda, made that could be kept in historical records and sent off to the rest of Europe. And those people were called \u201cles mannequins,\u201d from which also comes the name we know as the inanimate objects we see in stores today, as well as the French word for \u201cmodel(s)!\u201d So shout out to politics & King Louis XIV wanting to be a gilded peacock", "i had no idea that the terrorist attacks happened on the same day of NYFW. i just looked up an article that talked all about it and everyone\u2019s testimonies from that day. it sounds horrible. it\u2019d be interesting if you could make a full video on that topic and how the events that happened that day changed the course of the fashion industry. i know you briefly touched on it in this video but i\u2019d love to hear you talk about some of the stories and just how deep this really went. great video as always!", "My grandmother was a fur model for a department store in the Midwest (I assume in the 30s or early 40s prior to her marriage but I\u2019m not sure).

You give a good perspective into how an outsider sees the industry and I really enjoyed learning about the history.

Models can go into one of those two categories of commercial or high fashion/editorial, but this is not the ideal for an agency to do\u2013 the ideal for most models is to do a combination of both kinds of work. The modeling industry has become overpopulated and I guess that does drive down incomes, but there are so many agencies now that cater to more amateur models that don\u2019t make much money/those agencies exist solely to exploit models financially, so it brings those stats down on income.

I've read some of her research about this particular 'look' in the editorial fashion modeling field, where she explains why models look a certain way.

It's insanely competitive, can be very toxic depending on the environment, and of course there's a ton of racism present as well. That's not to say there aren't any good parts because a lot of models do genuinely enjoy their work, but I really liked how Mina summed it up in this video.

I am a fashion model working since a few years in the industry in fashion (first in France then Canada). I do mostly editorial, and a bit of catalogue for the money.

I personally like it better than \"model\" cause in my mind \"model\" can be anyone in front of the camera, it doesn't necessarily imply the person is a professional, knows how to pose and walk... But that's probably just me! Also fun fact there we have to do our own hair and makeup a lot in Canada... The industry has no budget anymore to pay anyone... I'm not black, I'm redhead, and I have a similar issue! MUA never have my shade, I always end up orange. So I totally imagine the struggle of my counterpart of colour... I totally agree on how the commercial girls are often the \"money girls\" in the agency! I have often been refused from gigs because \"You don't look commercial enough.\" which is their way to say you're not conventionally pretty.
