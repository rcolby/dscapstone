They were all free. \n\nEdit: I just noticed there are 3 free Calling cards and 3 emblems as well. All rewarded for playing original warzone",
        "I play alot of mmos i was looking for a grind but  damn i was hoping to carry my achievements over lol that was wishful thinking. So i basically i have to play the game over, i got plat smgs an assault rifles. Luckily im enjoying the game i havent played mw since 2010 i think.",

Going for emblems use to be so fun, but who cares if lobby\u2019s don\u2019t stay together? The new gen of cod players need to know how it felt to have a lobby go for hours and be able to check the leaderboards and emblems of the players it added so much",

Not everyone is a streamer and plays games for a living...but now there are challenges for platinum and I think the purple one. Before it was automatic if you get all in a category u would get platinum.. Now there is a challenge for platinum.. When I hoped on playing a bunch of people were complaining.. And my camos disappeared I no longer have platinum... Instead I have to do a challenge for platinum",
        "5:10 it's for a CHALLENGE, so the base camo challenge, he did not unlock gold yet, so it won't show, normal camos arent interesting either",

        "So I just hopped on and it won't allow me to access my platnium challenges for AR's, I'd been waiting for shoot house to come out and when I looked at the progress before today's update I had all 8 AR's done and had 10 Longshots for only the m4, now none of my AR's allow me to access the challenge dispite having every AR gold excluding the new dlc weapon, even my longshot progress on the m4 reset so I have no idea what the problem is, luckily its my only category I had all gold but still frustrating.",
        "Just wanted to say that I am so glad I found your channel. Your videos on getting gold/platinum on launchers/riot shield/knife have helped me a ton! Keep up the great content!",
        "Great content but I don't approve of the PAID battlepass and weapon Blueprints/Operators in a P2P game. If it was F2P I wouldn't mind so much but this is awful,  they do it eac hyear and it's why I won't buy till a deep sale.",
        "The ui got even worse. I didn\u2019t think it was possible. Also the challenged for the calling cards are horrendous.",
        "This makes my heart feel warm ngl, it was worth waiting and buying the vault edition. I haven\u2019t played the new season 1 yet, but i sure hell can\u2019t wait. I\u2019m so looking forward to it ngl",
        "Still no combat records!!!!! Still no point in playing then!!!!!!!!!",

        "If you think that 1000 br extractions is the hardest thing to unlock in cod history you never grinded black out operators\u2026\u2026..\ufe0f",
        "There is no need to see what camo you unlock\u2026 you will unlock it by the time you get to another one.",
        "Cyber attack is old",
        "Bro thank you so much no homo love you bro",
        "Cyber is back! Literary 1 of 3 game modes I played in modern warfare",
        "Thx for info as always",
        "is there a way to view what challenges to do for unlocking stickers?",
        "I don\u2019t like how they dumbdowned the solid color camos they\u2019re not as vibrant",
        "Thanks for covering all this man. Very informative ",
        "W",
        "Here's a tip get 95% of emblems and calling cards!\nGo to multiplayer - private match - create private match - call of duty league - CDL hardpoint - click but don't start. Then go to calling cards and emblems. All unlocked.\nCheers ",
        "They didn\u2019t add the double ex token timer",
        "Finally some content games been dry the last weeks",
        "U look like my aunt",
        "Lol no, they are like vanguard, weak and they aren't tracers, mw 2019 had actual tracers and they were the best",
        "Can we save blueprints?",
        "Hey I need help. So before the update I already had all my 8 assault rifles in gold and now I wanted to do the Platin challenge and it says I have 0/8 gold challenges completed. I can still put the gold camos on my weapons tho??",
        "Oh boy. That black on black CDL skin is going to be trouble in dark corners lol",
        "still no hardcore aka tier 1????",
        "Anyone know how to fix the issue of 0/8 guns gold on my Assault rifles there all gold I can't continue my camo challeges",
        "The gamemode punishes you for doing the best? Well atleast that\u2019s representative of SBMM as a whole",
        "There is a bug where I can't see the progression on camo base camos challenges, still says I am at 0 on double kills for the Lachmann-556",
        "Funny my shit aint poppin up not even battle pass nothing n i pre ordered the vault edition, never got my beta skin but got all the useless fkn charms and stickers, i hate cod devs, 186 dollars down the fkn drain",

        "my game runs worse now",
        "bro they fucked up the solid color camos.",
        "I really like the new gun screens. Being able to see how I'm doing in game without having to check the scoreboard and obscure my vision is very nice",
        "I'm gonna try warzone 2 but I'm never going to get the calling cards because I hate battle royales",
        "I want Cyber Attack back in multi-player!",
        "I wonder if that ribbon above weapon unlocked notification is just a placeholder for the proper image and name of camo?",
        "I unlocked some calling cards and emblems that aren't on that list. No idea how I got them",
        "Did they fix the offline mode ive reported it but not sure if it got through to them",
        "Hope they don't hide the k/d tracker behind a paywall again. They eventually put the watch in the battle pass after push back last time.",
        "cdl thieves skin looks like roze 3.0",
        "thanks for the info man, good vid. btw u need a better haircut my boy.",
        "Ghastly Green would be a sick camo for the Honey Badger. A suppressed, stealthy weapon with a ghost themed skin",
        "did you notice they made the NEON LOUD camo less green/less neon/less bright \n\n:( it was so perfect before",
        "If you have 1k BR Wins and DMZ you need to touch some grass. I feel like thats what you were thinking ",
        "Cyber was in mw2019",
        "ugh, the Modern Warfare aestethic is already done for",
        "I really like how well they organized all the challenge calling card and camos for this game so far its satisfying! Good job Activision, to bad the other UI is still clunky!",
        "So this confirms it ..... launch was a beta",
        "Nooooo stupid tracer bullets again!!!?? Noooooo this gonna turn into 19 and warzone 1/ fortnite all over again",
        "Dude, you're a sweat.",
        "And just like that realistic cod has went down the toilet with one update",
        "Will the prestige calling cards & Emblems be limited or like the Cold war system?",
        "I hate this nerd so much but he gives news so fast",
        "Did they add hardcore? I\u2019m stuck at work for another 6 hours",
