        "What I love most about the Zoren kill counts is how they have such a different style and vibe to the James ones. Same when Chelsea does one too. They don't just feel like a different person reading a James script. They all feel unique to the person hosting it.  That's awesome. =O:) -_-",

        "His son Tim Conway Jr has his normal upbringing from his father who was just a normal man he according to Tim Jr was more inclined to talk to just regular people and was not one for being around  the Hollywood world.  I listen to Tim Jr every night on kfi he has a program from  6 to 10 during the week.  And the way he speaks about growing up in his father house they were just a normal family  he had two Hollywood friends  one was Mike Conners  and McClean Stevenson  and both like Tim Sr were just regular guys that enjoyed horse racing and  just regular things.",

        "I never really liked many Minecraft content creators, but I gotta admit that I grew up watching him...even if we were the same age. And I guess that's what makes it hurt just a bit worse for me. I can't even imagine what that must feel like, being so young and at death's door, but still smiling through it all and telling everyone that everything was going to be okay. The countless days I would come home stressed and upset from everyday life, just to pop up one of his newest videos on my laptop with some snacks and just laugh at all the countless jokes and shenanigans he and the rest of the crew would get up to every day. The countless times I would repetitively re-watch 'The Great Potato War', in which I totally was not doing upon finding out this heartbreaking news. Alex was one of the top-tier creators that I feel proud to admit to have been a loyal fan of throughout all these years. Someone I looked up to, who could make me smile even on my absolute worst day. ",

        "1:53:07 Jack missed a pretty big King Arthur reference here. Nimue was the name of the Lady of the Lake, the Fae entity responsible for raising Lancelot like a son and both forging and gifting Arthur with Excalibur... hence the \"talented with a sword\" line.
