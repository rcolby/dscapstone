        "Can you imagine a game releasing in a state like this back on the SNES or before patches were a thing? Yeesh",
        "\u201cThe game\u2019s wavering performance did nothing do diminish the excitement of discovering the new Pok\u00e9mon\u201d\n\n\u201cThe developer gets away with it just thanks to things it does get right with the open world\u201d",
        "Day 1 update should help with fps problems right?",
        "Those performance issues are brutal. The game looks fun but it's unacceptable to release a game in this state. I'm tired of this crap. And people need to stop being okay with games released in a poor state and hoping it gets patched.",
        "Gamefreak needs to go back to 2d. This looks horrendous",
        "Looks absolutely boring. Thanks for the review.",
        "Every Pok\u00e9mon review I hear \u201cit\u2019s a step in the right direction\u201d. After so many tries, it\u2019ll never get to that final destination.",
        "I literally could not care less about FPS and I'm tired of every game review being obsessed with it, sorry",
        "Absolutely gutted with how bad the graphics can be ",
        "Wow it is really distracting how poorly this is running",
        "well shit.....sigh, I guess I'll keep playing Arceus I guess.",
        "Both mountable legendaries have ride-on/ridon in their names...hmm",
        "Ffs if they just updated that prehistoric switch hardware it could actually handle modern games. Of course there is a chip shortage but even so to make modern game development that much harder just to accomodate the switch is baffling.",
        "dont worry guys, emulation will fix this too. ghghghgh i love how ppl keep wasting actual money on games.. while everyone know the videogames era is over and atm there are like 2/3 GOOD companies out there. Nothing last forever guys... thank god we got elden ring before the great storm at least xD",
        "Are you kidding me? Another crab pokemon? ANOTHER CRAB POKEMON??\nThey're running out of innovative crab pokemon designs. This one just looks like a normal crab. Don't even call it a \"pokemon\" (pocket monster). Just call it a pokecrab.\nAlso the motorcycle pokemon design you ride will never not look incredibly dumb. What were they thinking?",
        ">Truckasaurus\nSee, this is why I trust you guys for game reviews",
        "Yall are so negative lol. This review was overall very positive aside from the technical aspects. Do you play Pok\u00e9mon for the tech? If so, how have you stuck around this long?",
        "wont buy myself but if i am given as a gift or can get for free why not. Would LOVE to play this on steam deck!",
        "The gyms sound disappointing. I was hoping they would have implemented a scaling system which would scale up gyms based on the order they are taken on. Too much to hope for from Game Freak.",
        "The Pokemon main series stumbles yet again. Put a fork it in.",
        "It boggles my mind that the incredibly popular Pok\u00e9mon franchise are okay with releasing games that look THIS bad lol\nI\u2019ve played BOTW & in comparison, Pok\u00e9mon games consistently look like they\u2019re 10+ years in the past. \nLegends Arceus was so fun but looked like ass. Why can\u2019t mainline Pok\u00e9mon games look/run better & incorporate some of the new mechanics that worked SO well in Arceus \ud83e\udee5 ",
        "glad I never pre ordered I had a suspicion this release would be the final nail in the coffin, I would rather they remade sun/moon or followed a similar world style (with better gfx) to sun moon i mean arceus wasn't great but the world was broken up knowing this was completely open it was obvious it was gonna run like a turd outta water",

        "I love how siglis can't do anything bc he's always trapped, It really made my day, I also love how he's just tormented! =O:)",
        "A minute in and this looks utterly awful.",
        "Hopefully the incremental improvements Pok\u00e9mon has made on the switch continue. The system probably has a few year left of new games. It might get a true GOTY level game in 2025.",
        "THAT G DANG 6 FPS SUNFLORA ",
        "As someone who thinks the performance issues in games like SMT V are over exaggerated, my god this game looks awful.",
        "def a skip for me,i dont get the hype",
        "This game should have come out in a year. We literally had another big Pokemon game THIS year. They could have polished up this one for another year and made it so much better clearly.",
        "The footage speaks for itself. Glad your criticism turned out to be valid, since other apologist channels tried to claim you were lying or exaggerating or were playing a beta not representative of the final product.",
        "Honestly I think gamefreak should just hire other studios to work on the game while they come up with the \"story\" and new pokemon.",
        "Can\u2019t wait to play it. Should super fun",
        "I cannot believe the game looks like this.",
        "still no bought legends arceus might buys it or wait fe enrage",
        "I think I'll pass on S/V. This whole time I've been watching trailers, I've  been waiting for something to impress me but to this day I haven't seen anything. Legends Arceus was more of a change to the formula than I think S/V is, and that's more what I'm looking for. At this point, I've accepted the performance issues as standard with gamefreak. I just want them to change the formula more and bot just slight tweaks around the edges.",
        "this looks absolutely horrid, why on earth would they even be okay with releasing this?",
        "Man oh man do some of these clips look bad",
        "Frame rate is soooooo bad.....",
        "Spoilers near 13:20 name of a pokemon that hasnt been  officially announced in the tm materials",
        "I was expecting this review to be scathing judging by the overwhelming negativity in the comments but it got a 7/10. \n\nI\u2019m personally still looking forward to the game but those performance issues are unfortunate considering Pok\u00e9mon games usually don\u2019t have too many performance issues or glitches aside from occasional lagging.",
        "What the hell is that sandwich animation near the end..? That looks like it would be a bad phone ad.",
        "This is why I don't buy Pok\u00e9mon games, minimal effort put into every new release. This is GameCube quality.",
        "Smt V was more bearable than this garbage.",
        "For 2022 and how successful GameFreak and Nintendo are, this game is simply unacceptable. It looks like trash graphically and performs like trash just by looking at this video alone. But bots will buy it and make them richer and give them no incentive to improve. Same thing happened to Halo, Call of Duty and Overwatch. These devs are liars and thieves.",
        "Still boycotting until they get rid of forced exp share ",
        "It\u2019s also time for Nintendo to make a much more powerful switch 2. It\u2019s 2022. Sub 30fps and 540p-720p res especially with graphics this bad is a joke smh",
        "OOF this is a new low level for gamefreak, those sunfloras, the wind hill and the NPC walking on 3 fps are hard to watch.",
        "I played Pok\u00e9mon ruby and sapphire on Gba (my last Pok\u00e9mon) and I feel I haven't really missed anything.",
        "The reviewer: \"The performance did nothing to take away from the excitement of pokemon..\" \n\nThese comments: \"Performance is trash, game is thus trash, skip, lulz\"",
        "Yeah.. No. Maybe later.",
        "This is a game in 2022 by the biggest franchise on Earth, and it looks like a ported GameCube game. I'm so tired of the incompetence of GameFreak.",
        "Can't trust what Alana hypes up about",
        "The graphics and performance look a joke.",
        "If you enjoyed Sword and Shield, and don't mind the buggy mess that it currently is, then you could buy it.\n\nCould.",
        "Welp. glad I checked this before I got any more tempted to get S/V. As soon as I saw all those sunflower pokemon running at once at a chopped up frame rate, I could tell it would be a waste of money.",
        "gosh this game is so ugly",
        "I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m not really interested until they stop being stuck on releasing a yearly handheld title",
        "I had to choose this game or Xenoblade 3.....It sounds like ill be happy with XB3 for now....",
        "It's still a positive review, really the only bug issues I see with all reviews are in regards to performance which kinda sucks but that's not why I play these games\n\nPeople saying the game itself is trash aren't listening to the actual review",
        "I don't think I can give Game Freak any more of my money. I did buy Legends Arceus, and it did a few things right. But overall, it left so much to be desired. These games could have came out 10 to 15 years ago, and still be dated.",
        "Can't Marry Nemona 0/10 Trash Game.",
        "HOW IS THIS A 7/10 AND SONIC FRONTIERS A 4/10, I SWEAR THERE'S AN AGENDA AGAINST SONIC",
        "I've seen games with a fraction of the budget and tiny team have better graphics, gameplay and performance. Looks like a fan game tbh.",
        "Runs abysmally but expected",
        "It just a complete rush job. They should've held it back 12 months.",
        "Crazy how we got a game that performs and run like this but also got games that can run 60fps continuous cut with beautiful graphics like gow ragnarok. Crazy how 2 companies can have such different approaches and passion and the bad one is the bigger one lmao",
        "Why does it look like it\u2019s in early access",
        "So you say frame rate was almost a deal-breaker....but it wasn't because there are new pokemon?",
        "I don't think any more Pok\u00e9mon games should be made on Switch. The next game should be on the successor system.",
        "Jesus those drops..",
        "Guess I\u2019m waiting for a sale then",
        "Looks like crap ngl",
        "I've been on the fence with this one after experiencing a bit of Pokemon burnout from Arceus. With the framerate issues on top of Scarlet/Violet leaving out some of the better features included in Arceus (sneaking, tossing pokeballs to catch, and it looks like also the visual/audio cues for shinies appearing in the wild), I think I'll give this a pass. Instead, I'll look forward to a much better, more complex game hitting Switch in just a few weeks: Siralim Ultimate. For any Pokemon fans who haven't yet played Siralim, I highly recommend it. It's like Pokemon for adults... even though I'm an adult who also likes Pokemon, ha. In any case, that game offers far better value, more complexity, etc than this one. It also scratches that \"gotta catch 'em all\" itch. I'll put a thousand or so hours into that, rather than a few hundred into this. All for a much lower price.",
        "If game freak doesn't issue a patch for the awful frame rate, I will lose my shit.",
        "Looks like @BabishCulinaryUniverse will be busy recreating some food",
        "This game would have been good if it came out on the GameCube or the wii. But at this day in age, it somehow doesn\u2019t feel like a new or next gen Pok\u00e9mon. \nBeen waiting for an open world 3d Pok\u00e9mon game since being a kid, and somehow it\u2019s still looks utterly dissapointing",
        "Only Nintendo fans buy something like this in 2022 :,D",
        "Well dang I thought this was finally the Pok\u00e9mon game that got me back into the series, but nah, I\u2019ll pass. Didn\u2019t even play Sword and Shield because it didn\u2019t seem excited or fun. ",
        "\u201cFor us the developer gets away with it.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s just\u2026 sad. Each generation since black and white has been worse and worse. More and more taken away. Now the games just flat out struggle running. And fans just let it happen because\u2026 nostalgia, I guess? No other dev would get away with this. Gamefreak has never responded positively to feedback post-launch, so if you honestly think they will, maybe temper your expectations. This is just sad.",
        "Wow..this game looks bad",
        "It's honestly pathetic that something as huge as Pok\u00e9mon has such lazy and souless devs.",
        "Definitely not paying $60 plus tax for this also geez it\u2019s dam near 2023 and still no voice acting \ufe0f",
        "I think I'll just get Temtem instead",
        "I remember when you bought a finished game, buying a future patched game is not my thing.",
        "For those who want to justify with \"b-but Switch\" please look or (please) play the 3 Xenoblade games on Switch\n\nThese games are in every possible aspect more demanding than Pok\u00e9mon, and have a lot of shit happening with a great performance, gameplay, soundtrack and graphics all on Switch.",
        "There are no excuses. There are 3 Xenoblade games with huge, detailed, dynamic open worlds with shit tons of things going on at the same time, BOTW, Bayonetta, come on.",
        "The game should be at least 60fps  damn",
        "Jesus Christ, get rid of game freak already and give Pokemon to another developer who will actually put some effort into for once, with great visuals and good performance.",
        "damn this game looks like a powerpoint presentation",
        "Honestly I've played undocked for 18 hours now and the game looks amazing to me, almost no technical issues. Except for a few times in the academy city",
        "I love how she gets inspired by movies, anime, and all types of popular tv shows to just keep us entertained. We love you Jess",
        "They should have kept legend arceus graphics",
        "As a competitive player I\u2019m very glad I don\u2019t have to deal with any of this",
        "You would think with a game that looks so boring visually they would at least figure out how to make it run.. But they don't care, suckers will buy it either way.",
        "Not the goofy ahh sound effects",
        "Genius Sonority should replace Game Freak!",
        "Jesus christ how can the graphics look like a wii title and still stutter so much",
        "Nintendo needs to upgrade their hardware for real what's wrong with these people they multi billionaires",
        "I\u2019m very, very concerned about what\u2019s going to happen when online co-op launches, I can\u2019t imagine the performance being any better in that mode and I don\u2019t think people are going to tolerate an even choppier framerate",
        "Those frames at 30s, the Pok\u00e9mon are moving at 5fps ",
        "Is it just me or does this game look like one of those Pokemon knockoff mobile games.",
        "I can't believe how terrible this AAA game from one of the most profitable companies in the world looks. \nGames from the (glorious) Nintendo Game Cube look years ahead from this graphic quality, and they came out 20 years ago in a 3 generations-old machine! \nXenoblade games and many other titles are a testament to the raw power the Nintendo Switch has. The hardware is no excuse. ",
        "Toby Fox (undertale creator) does music for the new Pok\u00e9mon!!!???",
        "The graphics and performance just look god awful. Lol. Simple graphics don't have to look this ugly.",
        "I remember watching this for the first time and knowing who techno is, it felt surreal. it's like one of us, the guys who grew up watching the Skydoesminecraft generation of YT. he wasn't even really \"Minecraft famous\" at that point. but there he was, stabbing ALL OIF THEM. it was epic. I couldn't believe it. \nI'm almost the same age as techno and it really hit hard how easily it can all just stop.",
        "This is all about the setup for Generation 10",
        "If pokemon went pixel art 2d i'd be back on board. The 3D doesnt look fun in the slightest.",
        "The j is an h sound in naranja",
        "I still don\u2019t understand how game freak manages to produce such low quality games, especially when they\u2019re only developing for the Nintendo switch.",
        "I\u2019ve played the beginning of Pok\u00e9mon Legends but hearing this makes me want to finish this game first before finishing Legends",
        "Seems like another one of those - dump your game and emulate kind of games... or use jailbreak and overclock the Switch in hopes of it helping. Since overclocking didn't help with Bayonetta 3 all that much because of the Switches awful memory bandwidth.",
        "I think the company rushes thier employees, they are vomiting out pokemon games so fast",
        "nintendo life was to generous this game deserves a 6 for having so many technical issues",
        "EDIT: I just overclocked my switch and it\u2019s running pretty well, reminds me of Botw graphics and performance maybe? closer to Arceus, but yeah it\u2019s pleasant when overclocked \n\nI\u2019m playing it right now on a modded switch and wow it\u2019s actually bad, a shame because apart from the tragic and unacceptable performance it looks very fun",
        "Seems I will once again be buying the game 'used' locally so that I am not paying full price for a haphazard game and not putting any $ in their pockets. Stay petty, trainers",
        "Here's my thoughts after getting it early.\n\nIs it a good game? Sure???? Are there some major issues in presentation, technical state, balance, design, game play and more? Absolutely! This game is a huge step forward from sword and Shield but several steps back from what Legends had done. The fact that the battling system is just as poorly done as sword and Shield is a huge flaw in this game when Legends had almost perfected turn based combat in the series. It's slow, sluggish and has serious balance issues due to the open world. You could hit a gym that technically should have been the second but it's your last and you stomp the gym with no problem. Or you could hit a brick wall due to the gym badges limiting how strong of pok\u00e9mon you can catch and have them obey you. I'm at the 7th gym and I can only catch pok\u00e9mon under level 50 despite the fact that the gym is hitting in the low to mid 50s in levels.",
        "No buying this garbage.",
        "How many times are we going to say \"Well its not realllly there yet but it means pokemon has a promising future\" until we admit pokemon is consistently behind the times in terms of game design and quality.",
        "I had my suspicions, money saved. Thank you",
        "This game is infuriating and garbage.",
        "Man those characters animated at 5 frames per second are jarring.",
        "Guess ill pirate it",
        "Damn, just watching the video this game looks like it runs in slow motion. Such a shame.",
        "At this point it\u2019s unforgivable how bad these games are. Every generation seems to be a step in the right direction but like cmon now! They\u2019ve had too many steps! It\u2019s inexcusable.",
        "How does it look this bad.... like there are too many technical differences between this and botw to compare but like, that was literally the first game on the switch and its a HUGE game. Game freak I'm begging you...work with game companies that focus on performance.. stop making ur own code! U have great game ideas! Focus on those! Outsource ur coding plz...",
        "I pre-ordered yesterday for THIS?!",
        "I\u2019m sorry but wtf gamefreak. This is embarrassing. There are games that look better on the Xbox 360. These frame rates just aren\u2019t acceptable.The switch can handle much better looking games smoothly so this is clearly a developer issue. Nintendo should have never let this game release and should have forced gamefreak to work with another studio to fix the performance issues\u2026 really hoping a fix comes out soon for this games seriously rough performance. This was gonna be a day1 buy for me but now? I\u2019m holding off. And I hope other people do as well. Nintendo shouldn\u2019t be rewarded with great sales when this is the quality their willing to release to people.",
        "I\u2019m still going to play but I will stay I\u2019m disappointed the performance is so poor. I could forgive Arceus because that was such a big step forward for the franchise but it seems like they did not make an effort to improve. It\u2019s moments like this where it feels like GameFreak doesn\u2019t care about the fans after all the years of supporting Pok\u00e9mon. Real shame.",
        "There's nothing in the overworld? Like really? How can they do that really is it so hard to make a tower that has a legend or a myth like they did in DPPT or HGSS",
        "\"Fixing this with patches\" only worked in Gen 6. And that's because they HAD to fix a game breaking glitch that destroyed your save data. \nUntil Nintendo develops new hardware, this will be the staple of how Pokemon games work for the Switch.\nAnd with the president of Nintendo wanting \"Players to continue playing the Switch for years to come\" That doesn't sit well with me.",
        "Gamefreak still using a Wii development kit. Somebody buy them a newer one, they can\u2019t afford it",
        "4:07 PAIN  THE FPS is unbearable",
        "highest grossing media franchise ever btw",
        "A 45 minute video from ACookieGod??? Yes. Im going to watch it all @12:30AM. Youre the best. I love you :",
        "Honestly gamefreak should be ashamed of how soulless they are. They puto in as little effort as is possible to still make a profit.",
        "This is an absolute embarrassment and inexcusable. Sure, the Switch is showing it\u2019s age, but we\u2019ve seen many examples of open world games running well on it. \n\nI think this falls down due to Gamefreak\u2019s laziness and/or incompetence. More so the former as they know, regardless of how poorly optimised the game is, it\u2019ll still sell well.",
        "So to add to my previous point, I genuinely think that if the performance is so bad that it is a noticeable detriment to the playability and user immersion of the game, then reviewers should be giving the game very poor marks across the board. That goes for IGN, NintendoLife, _insert review outlet here_. It doesn't matter how much fun various aspects can be, if certain aspects really weigh the game down, then the game should really be getting 4s across the board. Then when Nintendo comes knocking wondering why nobody's buying the new Pokemon game, they have the evidence before them. I don't really know how else to get the message across, because it seems like Nintendo and TPC just do not and will not care otherwise. A 7 just isn't scathing enough.",
        "I don\u2019t really get why people want voice acting in these games so bad lol it would be terrible",
        "oh my god the performance looks atrocious",
        "are those sunfloras for real?!!? yikes!!!!",
        "Is it hard to make a open world game for switch like xbc3? The game for me is a\nMaster piece for the hardware they had in hand\u2026 come on gamefreak step up your game.",
        "Why is fps so important  to some poeple",
        "lol. lmao.",
        "i hope in a few patches they'll fix the performance, atleast to a somewhat stable 30.",
        "Sounds like unfinished trash just like Arceus. Wish they would actually take more time on their games.",
        "This game does not look good, I may just buy Brilliant Diamond instead of this. It just looks like Pokemon Company gave up on creativity years ago.",
        "that framerate tho",
        "1:27 Oh... MY God what a wonderful showcase of how unstable the open world is.... A whole lotta pop ins, sluggish, and downright bad stuff happening in the background... Lets recap here shall we\n\n1. Once again not even the slightest intentions of voice acting...",
        "The 'Step on the right direction' saga. I don't get why this traditional and consistent dissapointment sells that well, with only the promise than the next one will be better.",
        "Pok\u00e9mon died a long time ago",
        "God the framerate looks atrocious",
        "and we thought sword and shield had a rough start...",
        "Yeah I think I'll hold off on buying the game for now and see if they are going to bother patching the performance of the game or at the bare minimum wait until I can find the game used so that way I'm not financially supporting the state this game is being released in.",
        "Well, thanks. Gonna stay with fireRed, soulSilver, Y, Moon and Arceus. But why the Legends one feels so bland, grey and boring....",
        "7 out of 10 for the biggest franchise in the world is not great, let's be honest. After watching several reviews today, the pop in and frame rate issues are pretty distracting. While I get the Switch is aging and we seriously need a Pro model to bump up those framerates and load ins (Hyrule Warriors needed it way before now!), Game Freak are once again sadly showing their budget and staffing doesn't match the quality and depth the franchise should be getting...",
        "Now this is a game I'm definitely not buying, not even in second hand or at a discount... it looks horrible and probably plays horribly as well. I'll say it cause the reviewers cannot, but it looks like a shitty game because of this. Pretty sure they could do way better, but they won't and the fans will eat all of it without a second thought, so this kind of development will continue further into future releases. To the people that will buy this game, good luck, hope you enjoy. If you do not, learn not to pre-order, specially a Pokemon game.",
        "I can't get over how jaggy everything looks with a lack of AA and in general, the peformance is just sad. Typical modern Pokemon...so frustrating.  Thinking on some of the technical feats on Switch, this is just so sad. At least you can make a sandwich though..",
        "GameFreak should adopt the Xenoblade engine.",
        "pokemon powerpoint",
        "Even the health bars just remind me of a Roblox game (from someone who only played Roblox once)",
        "Just wait for the day 1 patch. Why is everyone so quick to review before the official release date",
        "This game is a joke, right?",
        "Game freak wanted to develop this game as quick as possible and it just shows...",
        "Pok\u00e9mon fans: don't play this crappy game challenge (ultimate difficulty)",
        "cant take it seriously that they put a 60$ price on this piece of garbage, you just cant even defend it",
        "So relieved I didn\u2019t pre-order this.",
        "The game looks so bad it\u2019s hilarious",
        "The technical issues are certainly emblematic of Game Freak's general quality bar, but it also has to be due to the limited Switch hardware. This year has shown the Switch really struggling technically and I think i'll wait to play games like this until new hardware is available. Hopefully TotK will still run well...",
        "Ugh... I really really really want to like pokemon, but holy hell. They managed to worsen performance and neither the environment or animations look better to compensate. They halfway backpedaled on Legends Arceus' very solid gameplay loop. And while Terastallizing might be the most competitively interesting gimmick of the last few generations, the stupid little generic hats and accompanying bad \"crystal\" visual effects will never compete with the intentionally-designed-to-be-cool mega evolutions (and to lesser extent gigantamax, though regular dynamax was kinda boring too).",

Either way, I truly feel like the second generation Nintendo switch should have been released this holiday and was probably held back a year so developers had to struggle to work with a underpowered system like they did when they converted dozens on Nintendo 64 DD games back to regular Nintendo 64 cartridges.

I won't say the developers are lazy or whatever, who knows what kind of schedules and working conditions do they have, but to me it's clearly an issue that such a franchise would present this as a finished main line product.

How many more mediocre games that are a \"Step in the right direction\" will it take for there to actually be a great Pok\u00e9mon game again?

Wild pokemon stuck in buildings & other things (like that lighthouse at the start of the game), the Pokemon that are walking with people, walking through the ground & on the air, along with some NPC's doing an odd rather quick 360 spin at times during battles. But the slowdowns, are the worst bit. But that's games nowadays for you, releasing in broken states & fixed later. Is also far too easy to level your pokemon up just as it is in Sword & Shield, my Meowscarada is already level 95 thanks to those EXP candies, and very soon will be at level 100, thanks to the same things.

To many half baked gimmicks, too many stale designs, too many shallow stories and now a boring open world. Gold and Silver were so good, the remakes were amazing. Ruby and Sapphire were probably my favorites. They either are overwhelmed, over confident, overworked or simply creatively bankrupt and don\u2019t care. Either way, I had so many doubts about this game and was slowly won back when I saw what they cooked up. But really? This is their second go around and it feels like they did a cram session the night before release. Seriously, C- work for anyone else, but for a \u201cAAA\u201d company this has to be like a D.",

I want to interact with interesting NPCs that give me sidequests that are fun. I want dubbed cutscenes. I want Pok\u00e9mon to actually live in the overworld and not just idling and walking aimlessly. And for the love of god GameFreak needs map designers and storywriters.

This game has excited some of my friends for being completely open world and having co-op, but I've been more hesitant due to the designs and removal of the stadium battles and for walking back Arceus's open world battle/pokeball system.

Do XC2 & 3 or MH have as many things on screen at once or were these developers wise and kept the item count down in order to keep performance up (I\u2019ve not played these so can\u2019t judge for myself)?",

Christ), the pop-in, the glitches, the fact that they didn\u2019t even model the interior of the shops or the whole academy (!!!), it just feels like another rushed mess. We give Sonic SUCH a hard time but Pokemon is always forgiven and it\u2019s a real shame because the Pokemon Company and Nintendo are never going to change until we stop buying them.

It really feels like the reviewers can't really objectively grade the game without having nostalgia feelings from their youth.\n\nAnd one of the biggest failures is to compare Pokemon only with older Pokemon games. Of course it will be the best ans biggest game, but if you compare to other open world games on the Switch like Skyrim, Witcher 3, Xenoblade Chronicles 3, even Bayonetta 3 has some open world areas, SV gets crushed.",

They always take steps to improve from their previous games, but if you looked at the rate of improvement throughout the gaming industry as a whole, they're lagging behind significantly. Imagine a studio releasing this exact game completely unaffiliated with Nintendo or GF today. The only way it wouldn't be absolutely lambasted would be if it were from an indie studio, not one of the largest in the sphere. Like, I'm glad they're proud of their creation, but it's as if they've never seen what a finished, polished 3D game looks like, so to them this is the peak.",

Yes that is passable but you should always want something closer to 60 than 30, if it dips at 60 a bit it doesn\u2019t become a slide show. It may be the pc gamer brain of me but I find it atrocious that people will accept the bare minimum when it is 2023 soon.

I find disappointing that most reviews so far don't mention any of this. If they keep removing options, why are these games a step in the right direction?  Most of what I have seen in this review made me nod in disapproval. Sadly, I have been playing since gen 1 and since SwSh, I have been boycotting every game and will continue to do so while they keep removing options and treating their customers as brain dead people that cannot figure out how to find the exit of a dungeon.",

Nintendo seems content in treating the Switch as a handheld more than a home console at this point. I dare say; that games being released now perform significantly worse than in the initial launch years (The first Fire Emblem Warriors, Mario Oddessy, Bayonetta 1-2 all perform better than the recent releases). These issues are made even worse; when you consider that they can use AMD Fidilety Upscaling and the \"Update Dock Firmware\" feature (things that were not available at launch) to get even better performance than the launch games. The games coming out now; are the type of games (and performance) that a console has when it's on it's last leg and the company is starting to look to their next console. However, since the Switch is a different beast than anything that has come out before; they may just keep relying on retro and indie games; with some past gen ports (which strangely also have not been performing well this year compared to launch. Allan Wake looks worse than the 360 version, yet L.A Niore and all the RE games look and run better on the Switch than any of their past gen ports).",

        "I honestly feel like giving up on Pokemon games altogether. I will not be playing this",
        "why do mobile games like genshin look miles better  than the new pokemon game?",
        "Jus got a switch yesterday just for this game, should I jus buy and play legends instead ?",
        "im starting to think they caught on to the madden-nba2k formula.. keep putting out the same shit games every year & the masses will buy it anyway even if the graphics are shit..",
        "Pokemon fans will buy literally anything, I honestly think that there is no other gaming community with lower standards.",
        "Excusing this level of ineptitude on graphics and frame rate officially means you can't be objective... Disgusting.. they are a multi billion dollar company ... Indie devs are doing better nowdays... Nintendo simps confirmed",
        "Opportunity missed here boys! A simple update could fix a lot of this. But selling unfinished games is whack",
        "They should have brought back mega evolution. . . But my theory is that they got sued by digimon and that\u2019s why it hasn\u2019t come back",
        "I can honestly deal with a game having inconsistent performance as long as it\u2019s actually a fun and enjoyable time (looks at Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity), so hopefully it\u2019ll be the case with this game. It\u2019s just a shame that the technical side of Pok\u00e9mon always seems to be it\u2019s weakest aspect, which was the same case for Legends Arceus despite still having a blast with that game.",
        "So you CAN'T change your outfit from those school uniform",
        "Anyone complaining just go play GOW and shut up, this is the best POK\u00c9MON game of years and they will just continue getting better. Pumping out games is great when you enjoy the Pok\u00e9mon aspect itself, who cares about your tech",
        "Performance isn't really an issue for me in games where fast paced action isn't the focus. If this was a fighting game, character action game, or something like Doom Eternal I would be put off.",
        "I knew this game was going to be crap. I never buy any pokemon game nowadays. Back to temtem.",
        "I'm not going to defend TPC for the game's performance, though I will say they clearly underestimated the workload moving from a portable to a \"higher\" spec console,  but people think the Switch is some kind of \"miracle machine\" because Bethesda released Doom on it.",
        "Legends Arceus can handle open-world fps smoothly (no hard drops I noticed), why can't S/V?",
        "Just play actually good Jrpgs. Problem solved. Dragon Quest XI, Xenoblade, Monster Hunter Stories, Persona 5, Shin Megami Tensei V - there are just a dozens of jrpgs on Switch which dwarf Pok\u00e9mon.",
        "\u2018we hope that nintendo company can FIGURE OUT how to improve its performance issues..\u2019\n\nno, they are sitting on one of the biggest pots of gold the world has ever seen, there is no \u2018figuring out\u2019. jesus christ people are doormats",
        "Can't even get the pokeball noise right after all these years...",
        "Jesus this looks terrible... I love pokemon. I've been playing since red and blue and I really hope they can come out with something worthy of how much money this franchise rakes in... I'm not looking for 150 new pokemon. I just want a good game.",
        "I'm actually a little tired of the \"it's a step on the right direction\"  statement. We've been saying that since sword and shield (maybe even since sun and moon) and they still can't figure it out. \n\nImagine you're an artist and every painting you make they just say, ya, it's a good step!. Its become more of an insult than a praise.",
        "looks like an excellent game however its a pass for that framerate. thats crazy",
        "I'm planning on playing Violet on Switch. Though after I beat it, I plan on downloading an Emulator on PC to play Violet in 4k 60fps.  Not to mention modders will add DRIP",
        "Slap Pokemon in the title and people will buy it. Easy.",
        "Breath of the wild had some FPS issues when it first launched, especially in Kakariko Village which still exhibits the fps issues on the Wii-U version (which was never fixed) so there's at least 'some' hope that they can continue to optimise and smooth out the experience post launch right?"
