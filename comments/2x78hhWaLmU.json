Your brilliance, strength, courage and grace shown through every minute as you carried the weight of the world on your shoulders. I cannot even imagine the burden of simply sitting in the room with him, much less addressing him. I live on an island off the coast of North Carolina and I am 70 years old. You, Madame, are spectacular and a wonderful credit to humanity. I join our nation in thanking you for bearing this huge huge burden you have carried and resolved. You have my eternal admiration", "It\u2019s so nice to see her smile. She\u2019s a tremendously professional woman. I\u2019m so happy for her.", "Judge Dorow blew me away. I've never had a judge bring tears to my eyes reading out a sentence. She was absolutely brilliant. What a woman. Waukesha is lucky to have her.", "Sue Opper - you are an amazing attorney and I loved the fact that you held your composure in the face of Brook's insane disrespect for weeks, and then when you told him to \"Sit down and Be quiet\" during the final day of sentencing a huge smile came across my face! He deserved that from you, obviously. And I'm glad you said what you did to him in that moment.", "The prosecutors did a fantastic job on this case. Not because they had a difficult job showing it was Brooks but because they had to take a huge horrific attack and break it down for the court so that every victim could be heard and have their justice. Not to mention having a crazy man representing himself really does tie a hand behind their back. Plus they actually volunteered to help him by serving subpoenas for his witnesses. Well done Ms. Opper!", "The fact that this prosecution team was able to wrap this up before the 1 year anniversary is actually insane. Especially with this type of defendant, and the magnitude of this case. Sue, Leslie, Zach and the rest of this team did an amazing job for these victims, and of course the Judge did as well.", "I was very impressed with the prosecution team, the judge, the jury, and the people in the court room and how they all showed integrity and respect. As a viewer, I found myself wanting to yell at the monster\u2019s behavior throughout this trial. May God be with you all as you continue to heal.", "This woman and her team did an incredible job. They had to put up with so much and they moved forward strongly and got Justice. Also note the way she said \u201cour families\u201d when referring to the victims and victims\u2019 families. She took them all on and worked for them.", "From South Africa, congratulations and respect to you, your team and the judge.  Deepest sympathy to the survivors of this horror.", "After listening to the mother of the 11 year old girl, about how she had to care for her child after this horrendous event, and to the girl herself talking about the pain she suffers, and the amount of rehab she is still having to go through, I was enraged that anyone could cause so much sorrow, but was thankful that the man faced such skillful and dedicated prosecutors, Jurist, and law enforcement officers and such a focused jury, true justice was handed out to this offender, ( whom I choose not to dignify by using his name) now I hope, they will throw him in the deepest dankest cell in the most dilapidated prison in the state, throw away the key, and forget he even exists.", "Thank you to the whole prosecution team.

I\u2019m so grateful this is done and  to the community!!!!", "I accidentally ran over a baby bird hopping along the sidewalk when I was a kid on my bike. It crushed me. I still think about it and feel guilty for it nearly 30 years later. I can't understand how this man spoke for hours upon hours during his proceedings and NEVER even apologized. Prayers for his cellmate's knuckles ", "You are ONE heck of a human being, lady that represents justice and humanity! God Bless you, your family and the entire community \ufe0f", "Millions up here in Canada are with the people of Waukesha County as well.\n\nWell done to each and every one of you who prosecuted this case. And thank you.", "Judge Dorow and Sue Opper are so powerful and I know that these strong women got under Brooks' skin. So very thankful to them and the entire prosecution team and every witness who went through this trial with the patience of saints in order to put away such a horrible, conscienceless human being. Brooks tried to make a mockery of the system and had no regard for the lives lost, but Judge Jennifer Dorow gave such an amazing tribute to the victims in her closing remarks and sentencing. You can really feel how much love is in this community. I hope they all continue to find strength in each other.", "I wish I could send a message to this incredible woman and know how much I respect her and am grateful for her and her whole amazing team!!

I'm so glad for the victims and the people of Waukesha that this was the eventual result, and I feel like Judge Dorow has made certain that there will be nothing to hang an appeal on.

I thought of all in the medical field personel, down to housekeeping, that  examined and cared for these victims,  cleaned up the carnage that cane through the hospitals. I pray also for each of your mental health challabges,, it could not have been easy. Blessings if renewal for all.", "I want people to appreciate that they wrapped this up in LESS than a year. \n\nThat is highly unusual. For homicide cases, it can take years for a few charges.

Through court proceedings you could sure see the expression on all the prosecution's team faces of pure acknowledgement of seeing  pure evil.

The legal system in that county is above and beyond anything I have seen.  Brooks is an evil man and I cannot help thinking that a team of many women put him away for life.  Kudos to the whole team and community.", "What an amazing job The prosecution did and Judge Dorow was awesome, you could tell this case really touched her heart when she spoke and then she handed out the best punishment possible for that Monster, never have another free day as long as he lives. My heart goes out to all the victims and their families and now this is over hopefully they can try and rebuild their lives.", "There is so much wonder and pain this episode. The trauma from losing a child is heart breaking and the voice actors have done a phenomenal job portraying the anger, hurt, and pain. Freya, choosing restraint despite her own grief is powerful. The grandmother rejecting her granddaughter because shes scared to love anyone else because they might be taken away from her again ?", "Your team and the judge showed heroic patience with the accused.

May those families start to heal. You all have tremendous strength. Those victims will never be forgotten.", "Thank you, DA Sue Opper! You and your team did an excellent job of getting justice for all victims.", "That scene with the Norns is phenomenal! As I was watching it I realized each of their dialogue is written from the three different narrative points of view. One is a narrator speaking from a 3rd person perspective about the events transpiring, one speaks at the same time as the characters, which is basically  being in 1st person, and the other speaks directly to them as another participant in  the events, which is 2nd person. Props to everyone who worked on that scene (honesty, to everyone who worked on this whole game), that's such a cool way to write the dialogue for omniscient fates.", "Justice has been served. Well done Judje Dorow (exemplary & so likeable), & well done DA Opper (super lady too), she and her team did a remarkable job. I watched pretty much the entire trial here in France, and I'm happy that the defendant was sentenced to life in prison, it couldn't be differently given his atrocious attack/murders and his disgusting/unbearable conduct throughout this trial. A massive thought for the poor victims,  and their families, I hope they manage to live with this tragedy at some point, even though it's easier said than done of course...", "Thank you Sue for the wonderful job you and others did to get this sociopath off of the streets!

You did an amazing job and had the self control I can only wish for.  Thank you for your service", "I have so much respect for this woman and for the judge. The things Brooks said about her were as disgusting as he is. Atty Opper was the picture of professionalism and fairness throughout this entire process and actually did him some favors although he\u2019s too stupid to realize it. She\u2019s an amazing prosecutor and has incredible morals and integrity. The entire prosecution team were amazing and Judge Dorow as well. They should be the example for many people in how to handle cases like this. God bless the judge, the prosecution team, and the community.", "DA opper is an amazing woman.

They all worked incredibly hard.", "Thank you & your whole team for getting this done. Amazing restraint on all involved.", "Those prosecutors held their tongues and did their job professionally, putting up with things they shouldn\u2019t have had to endure. They can (and should!) hold their heads high. \n\nWell done!!!", "The judge was absolutely masterful.\n\nNotice the final moment of incredibly quick thinking on the part of Judge Dorow: she knew she couldn't allow applause for the whole sentence, but after it happened for the first murder victim, she allowed it to continue for them and ONLY them.", "Let's not forget the prosecution worked so hard to lay this all to rest before the anniversary of the massacre. And with an amazing judge at the helm, THEY SUCCEEDED. Now these families and entire community can mourn the anniversary finding peace in the fact that this creature is NEVER going to see the light of day again!

To the judge and all involved.... Wow, you guys put up with sooooo much B.S.!", "I love you. I am a black woman from Michigan and followed this case from day 1 and your entire team was amazing. \nI want to say I found his family to be just as delusional as he  is. Some laws should be revised.  How can anyone create such trouble every where they go and really get away with it.  All theses years he's gotten away with it.  No real serious consequences.   I've prayed for the families and for the healing of the community.   God bless you and team. And I can't leave out the judge.  She made sure she crossed her T's and dotted  all her I's so there could not be any thought of a miss trial. God bless you all and have a peaceful holiday.", "Job well done, DA Opper.

Pure class by this court.  So much love to each of the victims and family member.", "Phenomenal job they did and they worked so hard to wrap this up for the victims before the one year anniversary.  I'm sure that's worth everything."]}
