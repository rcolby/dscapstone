        "I was obsessed with model Fei Fei Sun for a while. Girl is stunning and a supermodel in my book. I don\u2019t remember ever seeing a Chinese model represented with that kind of caliber. She was the 1st solo Chinese model to grace the cover of Vogue Italia. But I think she\u2019s now semi-retired, and also gave birth in recent years. She\u2019s still very young and can make a comeback. The Asian powerhouse models in the earlier days include Devon Aoki, Kimora Lee Simmons & Yasmeen Ghauri. You are for sure an it-girl Mina!!! No cap!!!",
        "... US president Henry Ford????",
        "i respect the og 90s supermodels (and also a few working today)so much for their work and discipline, i just find it sad that today a lot of the \u201chighest paid models\u201d are just nepotism babies who don\u2019t necessarily have the talent and work ethic of other models who woupd deserve the fame more",

        "Honestly I do consider being a plus size model sometimes but seeing I have to keep the same size when I fluctuate in weight A LOT keeps me away from it. Plus (pun intended), it\u2019s not a very sought out job and the clothes promoted through fatter bodies is always ugly sadly .",
        "I like the vibe of these videos - no-nonsense deconstruction of topics. Modeling seems like a job were there will  almost inherently be this whiplash of the high of attention/ praise / status for models and the lows of criticism / objectification /often poor health and financial instability.  It's like the whiplash of being in an abusive relationship.",
        "US president Henry Ford? You mean Ford Motor Co president Henry Ford.",
        "I think there is a certain obsession with nostalgia in our culture today. Things change and that's ok. In the future, people will look at kendall, gigi, bella, hailey and will miss having lived in the era of it girls on instagram, of influencer models. I know that I like to accompany them. It's ok to like the 90's models but it doesn't make sense to think of reproducing what they were in a world as different as the one we have today. Anyway, this is just my opinion, I love your videos Mina!",

        "tiny jewish girl is such an it girl",
        "Going off of the first couple of minutes, I think it's also important to realize that not everyone can afford the lifestyle it takes to be an \"it\" girl. If you're in your 20s, trying to finish school or working a full time job, you might not have the time and resources to post consistently. Therefore you might not be getting the brand deals that allow you to keep going and stay \"trendy\" enough. Victoria Paris made a really good Tik tok about how she can afford the cool furniture in her apt (which helps her stand out) because she literally doesn't have to buy her own clothes -- they get sent to her for free. To be an \"it\" girl you basically have to be doing a media related job that let's influencing and being in the pubic eye your TOP priority. The only it girl I can think of that isn't a model, actress, singer, or full time influencer is Devon Lee Carlson (co founder of wildflower phone cases).",

        "Lane Bryant's continual use of models that run on the lower end of plus size can be frustrating.  It's nice to know that the size 14 model looks good in that outfit but what about a 20? 24? They go all the way up to 32, I believe and yet show no diversity whatsoever.",

        "Anytime there's money to be made, it becomes difficult to keep something exclusive. So as much as people miss the \"Supermodels\", everyone wants in on this which opens the field to more people (which duh, inclusivity requires that) but it feels a bit odd to hear that people want \"super\" this and \"it\" that knowing very well it doesn't come with a wide range of representation(?) Maybe sometimes people want to be excluded? Idk just seems odd. Ten or even five years from now maybe influencers who peaked in 2020 will be seen as the \"standard\" and those who \"had it all\". Nostalgia seems to distort the reality of the past. Anyway I learned so much in this video, very well researched Nina",

Yes I know there was no tv in the 19th century and no, I don't know when or even if the Islands ever got independence from the Empire, but it's hard to believe an ex-colony would take so long to have plain old tv - after all, ethnicals and expatriates use to effort a lot to bring developments from the homelands for their own benefit.

        "Hello Mina. I am a fashion model working since a few years in the industry in fashion (first in France then Canada). I do mostly editorial, and a bit of catalogue for the money. In French we use the word \"mannequin\" for fashion model. I have never really thought of it too much.  I personally like it better than \"model\" cause in my mind \"model\" can be anyone in front of the camera, it doesn't necessarily imply the person is a professional, knows how to pose and walk... But that's probably just me! Also fun fact there we have to do our own hair and makeup a lot in Canada... The industry has no budget anymore to pay anyone... I'm not black, I'm redhead, and I have a similar issue! MUA never have my shade, I always end up orange. So I totally imagine the struggle of my counterpart of colour... I totally agree on how the commercial girls are often the \"money girls\" in the agency! I have often been refused from gigs because \"You don't look commercial enough.\" which is their way to say you're not conventionally pretty. But modelling helped me embrace my own unique look, my oddness and celebrate all these \"flaws\" that make me unique. :) So I have no hatred towards the industry!",
        "I spent my entire work day on my feet steaming clothes for a photoshoot the brand I work for is having tomorrow and after an hour and a half of traffic hell I was thrilled to see  a new Mina video waiting for me. As someone who has been involved in the garment industry since I was a little kid (my mom is a clothing designer so I spent a lot of my childhood running around trade shows and helping out at photoshoots) it's always been so strange to see this glamorized image of what people think models do, vs the reality of it. It's insanely competitive, can be very toxic depending on the environment, and of course there's a ton of racism present as well. That's not to say there aren't any good parts because a lot of models do genuinely enjoy their work, but I really liked how Mina summed it up in this video. It's getting really difficult to make enough to support yourself even if you're just getting into low level catalog type stuff vs high fashion. It's not what it once was, and with the rise of influencers and so many nepotism babies around, it's only going to get worse. ",

Models can go into one of those two categories of commercial or high fashion/editorial, but this is not the ideal for an agency to do\u2013 the ideal for most models is to do a combination of both kinds of work. The modeling industry has become overpopulated and I guess that does drive down incomes, but there are so many agencies now that cater to more amateur models that don\u2019t make much money/those agencies exist solely to exploit models financially, so it brings those stats down on income. Most models I know are making a pretty good income, those that aren\u2019t are being worked by their agency in pretty exploitative ways (driven into debt, pigeonholed into low paying work, agents just aren\u2019t pushing enough to get their models work) ",

        "3:56 A bit of historical context for \u201cmannequin\u201d: King Louis XIV, arguably one of the most fashionable men & monarchs in Western history, was the driving force behind making fashion one of the primary, if not the premier industries of France because he realized that fashion can be a form of propaganda. Kinda wild to think of fashion that way for us nowadays but it makes sense. Louis XIV knew that courtiers across Europe looked to other courts on the continent yo help dictate what their own kingdom\u2019s/empire\u2019s court dress should be so they could be seen as their own independent governing power. So to compete with Spain & ESPECIALLY England given their long contentious history, Louis effectively tied a good chunk of the national economy to raw material cultivation, textile fabrication, garment making (hello, beginnings of today\u2019s haute couture!!), etc., so they could readily export all these products he would make be seen as valuable and drive up demand for by establishing a very highly aesthetic, super detailed (if not stringent) court dress to set France apart so when courtiers of other nations came to French court, they would have to get French clothing and then they\u2019d take those clothes back home with them. So with the fashion industry developing as quickly as it did in France, they needed to have people wear the clothes for fittings when the courtiers were out of country and to have illustrations, which were paper/art propaganda pushing the sartorial propaganda, made that could be kept in historical records and sent off to the rest of Europe. And those people were called \u201cles mannequins,\u201d from which also comes the name we know as the inanimate objects we see in stores today, as well as the French word for \u201cmodel(s)!\u201d So shout out to politics & King Louis XIV wanting to be a gilded peacock",

        "That was a great walk-through. Also, it's okay, you don't always have to end on an optimistic note, some things just need to be dismantled and this super-model business is definitely one of them. Modelling in general needs a huge transformation because in it's current form, it's not healthy for anyone involved and no one is being honest about it. The word \"model\" means \"to make a representation of\" and in science, a model organism is the most representative organism for a particular phenomenon you're investigating. Modeling is supposed to be a representation of, and yet, I don't see representation at all in the modelling industry, aside from the occasional token. When we as a people in all our forms and sizes can be adequately represented by this industry, then I might be willing to clue in. It's a shame, because I adore fashion and it's creativity, but with all the things they manage to pull off in fashion, you're telling me they don't know how to create beautiful things for the average American size? Or for anyone over 50? The list goes on. That's not logistics, that's a choice. The silver lining here is you Mina!

So if you're clothes on the rack reflect that, so should your models. The term \"plus-sized model\" shouldn't even exist because at the end of the day, they're all \"mannequins\" representing a tiny demographic that's hoping to buy something that makes them look cute.

        "It is so interesting because whenever I watch the 1939 Joan Crawford, Norma Shearer, and Joan Fontaine movie, \"The Women,\" I kinda get a glimpse of what modeling was like back then long before the 60s and even way before the supermodel era. The industry is definitely very complex",

It makes me so mad; in my job, i see so many women who hate their bodies and are comparing themselves to size 2s, and I wish they had never learned to hate their bodies.",

You can model and not make your sole income from it. I\u2019d say most models are like me & have to do other things but I model bc I love it & also respect my own personal boundaries - although I\u2019ve been in sketchy situations:/ and that\u2019s a big issue with this industry which commodifies mostly female bodies\u2026",

There were more stories in papers about models abusing their assistants, etc. I think pretty soon we are just going to have AI created models, after all, with photoshop, the models don't even look like themselves by the time they arrive in print.",

        "When I buy clothes online, I look at the pictures to see if the way the models are posed is hiding something. Part of modeling culture seems to be taking something that may be made at the last moment or in a slapdash manner, and then making it look better than it is, which I can only guess adds a lot of pressure to the models themselves",

She also did window dressing for them, so that certainly suggests the pay for modeling alone was not great. I do have a newspaper ad for the store, featuring her. I wish I\u2019d been able to ask her more about it.",
        "Hi Mina, thank you for sharing the whole background of modeling history with such clarity. I have been modeling for five years now (I am 25), for freelancing gigs. I am not very tall (165 cm) and I mostly work for independent projects and exhibitions. I truly believe that social media is getting modeling much easier to reach, therefore it's a saturated path: as you said, high fashion brands prefer to work with celebrities, while the rest of the gigs are superficial and short term. Unfortunately, if a girl is seriously interested in getting a modeling career in the runaway shows, there are a few well-known agencies which work for prestigious clients (such as Elite models). The rest of the agencies might work or not, depending on its popularity, location, the agents, etc... although they may offer just a few gigs once in a while. ",

The thought of people working on my hair and makeup at the same time sounds like so much fun. My mom would always tell me \"I'm all dressed up with nowhere to go\". Buuuut with my 5\" 3' frame, xxx lbs, tattoos, \"wide\" hips, and eastern European nose, I'd be put in this weird edgy group you're talking about. I also know that, as someone who is in recovery for ed's, it would destroy me. I will remain dressing to the 9's to get coffee as I always do for now.",

        "it really sucks that modelling is so entrenched in unattainable beauty standards because i think it has the potential to be something extremely empowering and fun. like, imagine a world where anyone could model without being forced to change. imagine a world where anyone's body and features could be celebrated in such a way on a wider scale. imagine how fulfilling and freeing it could be if anyone was able to model and express themselves in that way, to make their bodies into art as a profession. but no, instead modelling as a profession is used to put limits on people. it makes me sad that the modelling industry - and by extension the fashion industry - is the way that it is.",

Also what I\u2019ve noticed also since Im from NYC It\u2019s really important to have develop an image of yourself on social media you basically have to become an influencer/celeb just to continue having a consistent model career unless (you have a trustworthy agent in your corner ofc) I believe that\u2019s what the tiktok in the beginning was referring to as well.",

When I modeled I straight up would not apply if a designer didn't use measurements. Asian designer always provided measurements in cm, although their sizes run much smaller, even compared to the average person in their respective countries. ",
        "I think we need a part two because there's so much else problematic to talk about with modeling! Exploitation of young girls, drug use, low pay and ageism to name a few. I don't know if it's better now but I remember reading about some really wild stuff in the early 2000s-2010s.",
