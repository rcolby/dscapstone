I haven\u2019t finished hearing the pitch yet so I don\u2019t know the details yet of how his thing stays cold cuz he did pull it out of a fridge \u2026 So that means that if u need a fridge to put the container in\u2026 then his product is completely redundant cuz you can just put the Bottle Inside it !!",

I woulda done 50% only if I could get enough money to develop it and get a good amount of inventory, and to create a website.

        "perks of being a billionaire",
        "The more I watch the show the more I have respect for Kevin, he's harsh but honest. In the end I think Kevin's deal would have been better, Mark's offer did nothing for this guy. I just can't imagine Kevin taking 50% of this company and not making anything happen. People just seems to get caught up in the emotionalism, the company didn't pan out and maybe it's because of Mark's contingent deal. Kevin had every right to ask 50% of the company that was barely in the prototype stage.",
        "good deal ! but dont forget that sharks help each others !",

        "I think him saying how bummed he was when mark went out probably endeared him a little. Plus mark has a hero complex when it comes to saving entrepreneurs from Kevin\u2019s sharky deals. I wonder just how much mark has lost on all of his pity deals. ",

        "great invention",
        "This was more entertaining, gripping, thrilling, and instructional than I thought. I'm learning about high stakes business just from watching Shark Tank.",
        "I've seen Mark do this 2-3 times when he thinks somebody decent is getting hosed.  Honestly, even if the deal never went through it saved this young man from having to make such a huge decision on the spot.  He can get 100K for 50% anywhere, that wasn't special.",

        "Kevin is always too greedy",
        "What a dumb product. I don't see this going anywhere especially with the competitor being so much more cheaper.",
