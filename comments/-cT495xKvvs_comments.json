        "A lot of people thought this was official and it does look good",

        "Yet again Pixar back at it again with a masterpiece. Tbh I think Pixar is the only studio that is so god at making a \u201ckids movie\u201d that appeals to everyone and every age. They have made some of the best movies in animation and I can\u2019t wait to see this one. Also very good teaser already gives you the vibe and setting without spoiling and really gets that hype going for the movie.",

        "I cant help but notice the emphasis on the interaction between characters; everything one character does ends up benefiting another in some way. The only negative reaction is when Wade tries to help Ember, and slightly hurts her. Ember is also the only fire person in the train, and is seen moving carefully to avoid others. Perhaps thats what the movie will focus on, Ember living in a world where it feels like everything she does either gets her hurt or hurts someone else.",

        "water boy and lava girl like that cool math game",
        "Even though story could be or maybe kinda predictable I think the environment, characters and setting are so pretty and creative. I like the music too that's in the trailer. I will watch this on my own and hopefully it will change it do something differently with the \"forbidden\" romance trope or they do something different entirely. This is definitely on my list to watch",
        "Wade? As in Wade in the water???",
        "ember\u2019s design is so satisfying",
        "WHY WOULD YOU TURN THE GAME INTO THAT AND WHY IS THE FIRE A GIRL INSTEAD OF WATER?",

        "cool math games coming in clutch for this",
        "One itty bitty thing I noticed is how Ember has a hard time being in a relationship with every other element whereas Wade is the opposite. \n\nWade is compatible with earth because fertilization. Wade is compatible with wind/air because water creates precipitation/rain. Wade can be with water. Wade CAN be with fire, although it's a harmful relationship for the fire - and if the relationship is too heated he can evaporate. So essentially, if he pushes too hard for her, she'll be harmed and so will he if he stays in her life for too long.",
        "So cringy",
        "Well, after Lightyear, it's very nice to see something fresh, new and original from the studio. I\u2019m not sure what else to say about the trailer, other than having wonderful animation that's flowing with life and wonder, and wonderful voice acting. I\u2019m hooked, and I can\u2019t wait to see more.",
        "wuts this song?",
        "They tried making sth new that seemed genuine and interesting. and then the stereotypical bus meeting / boy whose nature is hurting the girl, kind of thing. that's why management people should not touch scripts.",

Have a main character who's a social outcast (usually due to some glaring on-the-nose physical characteristic).

At first, I suspected that maybe fire elements might not be as welcome in the area as fire can be quite destructive, but watching the video, you can see that no one is surprised or frightened by her appearance as she boards the train, leading me to believe that this might just be a coincidence. However, there are a few characters on the train that send her quick looks and nearing the end of the teaser, around when Ember reaches the doors, we can see an earth-type mother pulling away her child as Ember passes them, As Ember walks passed everyone on the train, we get to see exactly how the elements air, earth and water all coexist together and how they complement each other's elements, we cannot see this with Ember or any other fire types. it might be possible that the film will showcase discrimination in this way.",

        "What I love about Pixar trailers is the fact that they release only when you least expect it. Unlike other movie studios where they're always like, \"NEW TRAILER TOMORROW\" Pixar just releases it out of the blue. God I love this studio ",
        "Next we're going to get a movie about a neutron that dreams of being a proton",
        "Disney:\u201dso that adventure time story arc where flame princess thinks finn is an element of water!\u201d\nAnimators:\u201dyea?\u201d\nDisney:\u201dYOINK!\u201d",
        "Yesterday I was actually thinking about how unprofessional trailers can be, and how I\u2019ve never seen a worthy trailer, and coincidentally, this comes along. Compared to other trailers, this just shows the characters and setting, the only 2 things we should worry about right now. Kudos to the person who planned this.",

        "that's... actually a pretty good teaser trailer. it literally left me speechless, simple, unique and straight to the point with good delivery all that's left is the movie",
        "I can't believe Pixar made an animated movie based on the \"Fire Boy and Water Girl\" game.",
        "Oh yes im def watching this",
        "I like how the water element guy is the slightly clumsy one.\nFire is considered destructable and unpredictable,despite the fact that if you see a fire,it typically looks quite elegant.",
        "Fun fact: air, earth, fire and water aren't elements.",
        "Anyone else getting Zootopia vibes?",
        "yall gotta stop using that horrible looking 3d animation man i miss the old ones",
        "1:02 oof that earth elemental with the rock look going on, probably doesnt want any grass growing but he's got the water dude sleeping right on him.",
        "When this was first announced, I had zero interest in it because I thought the concept was dumb. But now that the teasers finally released, I've changed my tune, this looks absolutely gorgeous.",
        "No.",
        "I have to hand it to Pixar here- The setting looks amazing, and it's visually stunning.",
        "Once June comes, this movie will become mind blowing for long years to come. Any significant details between how we will see which villain will take the spot light. No to mention that Pixar can figure out something of it's improvements and make this movie very delicate and clean for the most part. scientifically proven this on Disney Plus besides putting in theaters, I Don't think or might aired at some point though. ",
        "Ah yes, the ideal teaser. The 2 protagonists on a train, nothing related with the plot shown in the teaser, just a train.",

        "I found the A113 at 0:15!\n\nSo we have the A in the circle, and then -- in the boxes -- we have H and Al, which are Hydrogen and Aluminum, #1 and #13 on the periodic table of elements! That's so cool!",
        "i can\u2019t wait to see more of how all these characters interact with each other, it already looks super creative so far",

        "It's actually really interesting to see different reception to this trailer on different platforms. Here, it's all love and appreciation for the art and the detailed animation, the personality shown within the animation, analysis of the trailer, general praise on the fact it's a trailer and not a spoiler. Whereas Twitter has ppl think this is too basic of a plot premise ('forbidden lovers/friends' - although this is just speculation) and missed opportunities for environment design (e.g. they're elements but they just use regular public transport all in one lump) the things about the character and suggested narrative (e.g. this trailer has ppl side-eying ember and she appears to be the only fire character. having a fire character in world of plant + water could create some really interesting conflicts but ppl are speculating it's going to a cliche plot)",

        "I\u2019ve noticed that she\u2019s the only fire element on the train, and you can see some of the other elements notice and look at her. But Wade doesn\u2019t look afraid, and I think this will have a big plot in the storyline. Like how Zootopia was afraid of predators, maybe they\u2019ll be afraid of fire?",
