It was obvious that it was spicy to you, you just happen to handle it very well, a lot better than the average person would have:-) most average people would fail the challenge very quickly, and the minority of average people would have just suffered a bit more than you did in this video. I do have to be honest and say that I am shocked that for someone who doesn't claim to consume super hot spicy pepper products everyday, I am very impressed by how easily and well you handle this. Good job bro:-) ",
