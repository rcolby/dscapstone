Such a different dimeanor than when Flo was here.", "28 years of being a Dol-Fan and it is FINALLY nice to have a franchise QB and an amazing head coach. I can\u2019t wait for the years to come with these 2. Truly blessed. Fins Up!", "The chemistry that Tua and Mike McDaniel have is unbelievable. You can tell they really care and love each other.

Thank you Mike McDaniel for helping Tua cook!", "What a class act!! Uno is ELITE and humble.", "He's such a wholesome dude. Very easy to root for. Looking forward to everything else he's about to achieve!! ", "I almost cried watching this. WTF. \n\nWe been through a lot the last 15  years guys....this is insane. \nThere's room on the bandwagon, everyone is welcome, just know there's fans that are touched by these performances we you guys are def different than any other team personality wise and genuine characters. Love you all <3", "I'm a life long Dolphin fan. It's been rough through the years. When we first drafted Tua, I was skeptical (Also, I can't stand Alabama since I'm a Gator) I wasn't sure about his injury status, although I have always admired his abilities. With all of that being said, fast forward to now, I've never been prouder to be a dolphin fan. I love my team and the energy and positivity that Coach brings. McDaniel is a genius and has really supported Tua and has believed in him. That has translated to an amazing metamorphosis of his game as an NFL quarterback. The additions that Grier has made to support Tua is amazing to witness. We have the team, we have the leadership and we have that undefeatable spirit that could potentially be a dynasty in the making. Phins up!", "I love this young man. He deserves all the praise he\u2019s getting now and in the future. I\u2019m really starting to believe this is going to be a magical season!", "This is amazing, he\u2019s so happy.", "This is the  Tua!  Productive and happy!

My niners be taking Ls but I haven\u2019t missed a Dolphins game the last two seasons. Love this team, hope they go all the way!", "Just look at this dude!! Look at him in this vid... no one can tell me hiring mcdaniel isnt the best thing this franchise has done since drafting Marino... sorry but flo had to go so we could get the best head coach in the league... I\u2019m so happy for tua and everyone on the team.. I cannot believe how much fun they\u2019re having and how well they\u2019re playing and this transformation happened in 1 off-season.. that\u2019s insane!

As a Bama fan my whole life, Tua was the best QB that I\u2019ve ever seen.  The guy is just incredible. Great competitor with a heart of gold. Fins Up! Roll Tide! \ufe0f", "It's awesome how its not the defense and offense as separate units anymore. It actually looks like 1 whole team who supports each other. Tua is just an amazing leader and I have a new respect for Teddy after watching this. He is supporting Tua and I think I saw more emotion out of him in this video than I have when he was on the field. I could not be more excited right now!", "I've never seen anyone so calm and confident in my life at one of the most important positions in any sport. I love it", "Why is he so humble?? I LOVE IT!! PHINS UP ", "Tears of effen joy. Go Phins. Phination can't be anymore happy for our dog, Tua \"The Samoan Sniper\"", "Tua laughed and danced more in 1/2 of this video than in his first 2 years here. It is BEAUTIFUL", "I freaking love this team!!!", "For a guy I\u2019ve never met and will probably never meet- I love this guy. Lead us 1  ", "As a Dolphin fan of almost 30 years I've never seen an offense this good. I don't even know how to feel right now ", "I\u2019ve been a dolphins fan for 22 years of my 30 year old life\u2026a die hard fan at that. I remember that 1-15 year like it was yesterday. Something about this team just feel different, unlike any other dolphins team I\u2019ve had the ability to watch. Every time I see them play it puts a big smile on my face.

They are my favorite team to watch this year!", "Gotta love the energy Teddy gives Tua glad he\u2019s own the team", "The way Tua made sure jeff wilson was safe but so much joy in my heart", "Not one bad word ever comes out of his mouth, any of them!  What an absolute joy to watch. Love this team!", "Never seen my QB this happy  you deserve it all uno !!! New Miami let\u2019s go!!!", "We must protect this man at all costs for so many reasons.... What a good dude, and an EXCELLENT baller", "What impresses me the most about this video is what a great teammate he is...he's just one of the guy...no ego.
