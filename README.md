# YouTube Trending Video Dataset
## Exploration and Sentiment Analysis

This is my capstone project from the [Data Science Certificate](https://www.uclaextension.edu/digital-technology/data-analytics-management/certificate/data-science) program through UCLA Extension. For this project, I used the US data from the YoutTube Trending Video Dataset.

I began by importing the data and creating some charts. Due to time and reource constraints, I created a subset of the most recent videos to scrape. Since the pages are dynamic, I had to use [Selenium WebDriver](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/) to open each page and scrape the data. A random sample of 500 comments was selected. After that was completed, language detection was used. I used [VADER](https://github.com/Holek/vader_sentiment) to perform sentiment analysis on the English comments. At some point in the future, I would like to explore sentiment analysis for other languages, or translating comments.
